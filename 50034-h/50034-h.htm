<h2><a name="Foreword" id="Foreword">Foreword.</a></h2>


<p>The lives of 5,000 young girls are laid upon
the altar of lust every year in the city of Chicago
alone.</p>

<p>The insatiable rapacity of man, the lust of the
hunt, the demands of brutish passion ordain it
that these 5,000 young innocents be led forth to
the slaughter, annually.</p>

<p>This statement is not a matter of guess. It is
the estimate of officers of the Chicago Law and
Order League, the Illinois Vigilance Society, the
police authorities and Assistant State's Attorney
Clifford G. Roe.</p>

<p>There are 68,000 women leading a nameless
existence in the city of Chicago alone. This is
the police estimate, based upon a census made by
the captains of the different police districts. It
includes the women who live&mdash;and die&mdash;in the
temples of shame on Twenty-second street, on
the Strand in South Chicago, on the West Side,
and on Wells street and vicinity on the North
Side. It includes the "street walkers," the girls
who infest such dance halls in Twenty-second
street, the women in private flats, and the mistresses
of wealthy men.</p>

<p>The average duration of a woman leading a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
life of shame is from two to twelve years, according
to Dr. L. Blake Baldwin, city physician. Dr.
Baldwin places his average at four years, basing
this upon the life of the woman in the brothel
where the majority of fallen women are to be
found.</p>

<p>Drink, which goes hand in hand with vice,
cigarette smoking, various kinds of "dope," the
all night method of living and the daily vicissitudes
of existence are the contributing causes,
according to Mr. Baldwin. But the chief cause
of early demise is the ravages of diseases inseparable
from immoral life.</p>

<p>The result is that the market houses are yawning,
constantly holding forth an insatiable maw
into which new blood must be poured, new lives
must be thrown, more young innocents must be
devoured.</p>

<p>And this is the reason for the existence of this
book. If one mother or father may be warned
in time, if one single life may be saved from the
traps men make and the lures they bait for the
enslavement of the flower and innocence of the
nation the author will have been well repaid indeed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A great many persons are yet skeptical of the
existence of an organized traffic in young girls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
If they could have been in the courts of Chicago
their minds would have been disabused of the idea
that organized slavery does not exist in Chicago.&mdash;Assistant
State's Attorney Clifford G. Roe.</p>

<p>Within one week I had seven letters from fathers,
from Madison, Wisconsin, on the north, to
Peoria, Illinois, on the south, asking me in God's
name to do something to help find their daughters
because they had come to Chicago and disappeared.
The mothers, the fathers, even the
daughters must be educated regarding the lures
that men set or white slavery can not be abolished.&mdash;Judge
John R. Newcomer, of the Municipal
Courts.</p>

<p>This book should go into the homes of every
family in this wide nation, rich and poor, sophisticated
and unsophisticated, city homes or country
homes. It is only when parents <i>realize</i> the
pitfalls that they will be able to avoid them.&mdash;The
Rev. R. Keene Ryan, Pastor of the Garfield
Boulevard Presbyterian Church.</p>

<p>Weakness and lack of understanding appeal
to me as the opportunity for the work of these
human vultures. That young women passing
the ages of from 15 to 20 years need more counsel
and guidance than many good mothers suspect.&mdash;Judge
Richard S. Tuthill, of the Juvenile
Court.</p>

<p>The victims of the traffic are first ensnared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
then enslaved, then diseased. Not until honest
men take the stand that will result in the abolition
of the segregated districts can this practice of
white slavery be stopped.&mdash;The Rev. Ernest A.
Bell, Superintendent of the Midnight Mission
and Secretary of the Illinois Vigilance Association.</p>

<p>The recent examination of more than 200
"white slaves" by the office of the United States
district attorney has brought to light the fact that
literally thousands of innocent girls from the
country districts are every year entrapped into a
life of hopeless slavery and degradation because
their parents do not understand conditions as
they exist and how to protect their daughters
from the white slave traders who have reduced
the art of ruining young girls to a national and
international system.&mdash;Hon. Edwin W. Simms,
United States District Attorney at Chicago.</p>

<p>If parents will shut their eyes to this canker
that is feeding on the flower of our nation they
may continue to expect their daughters to be
"kidnapped," lost or mysteriously missing.&mdash;Arthur
Burrage Farwell, of the Law and Order
League.</p>

<p>A young reporter for a great Chicago newspaper
was sent by his city editor into the heart of
the "red light" district to investigate a murder at
one of the city's brothels.</p>

<p>The trail of the story led the reporter into one
of the most notorious dens of the city, the "E&mdash;&mdash;
club." This home of vice is located in a three-story
stone mansion. Around it radiates the elite
of the district. It is owned by two sisters, immensely
wealthy, who have made their fortune
through the barter of girls' souls.</p>

<p>A negro butler attired in livery admitted him
into the reception room of this gilded den. Velvet
carpets that sank beneath the feet covered the
floors. Massive paintings by old masters were
on the walls. The gilded ceilings radiated the
glare of vari-colored lights which studded it.</p>

<p>From the silver dance-room came the sound of
soft music, interspersed with the discordant
laughter of drunken men and girls.</p>

<p>In a few seconds a woman entered the reception
room. She was prettily clad in a flowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
silk gown. Her mass of black hair was wreathed
about her head.</p>

<p>As she met the gaze of the reporter she started,
and fled, as though terrified, from the room. The
recognition had been mutual.</p>

<p>In the face of the fallen woman the reporter
had seen the features of an innocent girl who had
been a playmate of but a few years before.</p>

<p>Her family was wealthy. Her father was one
of the most prominent surgeons in Illinois. In
the city in which they lived he had served several
terms as mayor. She had been the belle of the
town. Her many accomplishments and innocence
had won her many suitors. But she
spurned them all for the love of her father and
mother. She was the only child in the family.
Her every wish and want had been fulfilled.</p>

<p>But a year before the reporter had heard that
she had died. The papers in the town contained
articles at the time lamenting her death. According
to the stories, she had been drowned in Lake
Michigan while sailing in a yacht. A body of a
girl supposedly that of her's had been shipped
home. There had been a funeral.</p>

<p>Since that time the father and mother had
been disconsolate. The memory of the daughter
was never from their minds. They spent the
greater part of the days at the side of the grave
in the cemetery. After dusk had fallen they sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in the pretty boudoir that had been the room of
their child. Not a thing had been touched in the
room. The beautiful dresses and garments that
had once been worn by their daughter still were
neatly hung in their places. The little mementoes
still lay about the room. And in the dim
light that radiated from a fireplace the father
and mother could picture the face of their daughter,
whom they believed to have been so ruthlessly
torn from them by death.</p>

<p>Quickly recovering from the shock, the seeming
apparition had given him, the reporter dashed
after the girl.</p>

<p>She ran into a room and attempted to lock the
reporter out. He forced his way in. As he did
so, she fell at his feet screaming and pleading.
Her mind seemed to have suddenly become unbalanced.</p>

<p>"Don't tell papa and mamma I'm alive," she
shrieked; "they believe me to be dead and it is
better so. I'll kill myself if you tell them."</p>

<p>The reporter could scarcely believe that girl
could be the same innocent, high-minded child he
had known but a few months before.</p>

<p>After much persuasion, she was finally calmed.
She would not lift her head or look into her childhood
friend's eyes.</p>

<p>"Come and get out of this fearful hole at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
once," the reporter demanded, grasping her by
the arm.</p>

<p>The crying of the girl ceased. Her muscles
grew tense and rigid.</p>

<p>"I will stay here," she said quietly; "stay here
until I die. No pleadings will change me. My
mind has been made up for some time. I'm an
animal now. The innocent girl that you once
knew is now no part of me. I'm all that is bad
now. When I leave this life, it will be in death."</p>

<p>"But your father and mother would receive
you back&mdash;they needn't know anything of this,"
pleaded the reporter.</p>

<p>"I'm dead to them and in death I am still pure
and innocent in their eyes. They are happy in
their belief," slowly said the girl, her eyes filling
with tears. She paused for some time, a faraway
look in her eyes.</p>

<p>It was as though she were gazing into the past
of but a short time before. Her features assumed
those of the innocent girl she had been,
then as she thought they gradually seemed to
grow more hardened and steel-like. Finally,
after some moments she broke the silence.</p>

<p>"I will tell you why I am here," she said. "I
will tell you why I will not go back.</p>

<p>"You can remember, not a long time ago, when
I was all that was good. I hardly knew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
meaning of a profane word. I was worshiped
and petted.</p>

<p>"I have done some good in my life. It was
this good and the hope to do even more that
finally led to my ruin. In the convent where I
went to school, we had been taught to be charitable.
I was happy in helping the poor and sick.</p>

<p>"The fact that my father was a physician gave
me an inspiration. When I had reached my
twentieth birthday, I decided to learn to be a
nurse, so that I might do more for the poor. In
the home town I could not do this. So I went
to a neighboring city and entered a state hospital.
There I worked as a common apprentice nurse
for ten months. I did not receive any pay for
my services. I had plenty of money anyway.</p>

<p>"I grew to love one of the physicians. He apparently
loved me as much. My life seemed to
be tied up in his. He asked me to marry him.
I was overjoyed at the thought. We were constantly
together and I was radiantly happy.</p>

<p>"One night, he made suggestions to me. He
said we would soon be married and that in view
of that, it would not be wrong. I trusted explicitly
in him and believed what he said. Then
I fell.</p>

<p>"It is useless for me to try to tell you of the
lies, the protestations of love, the excuses and
suggestions he made that caused me to fall. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
one could understand that but me. No one could
excuse it but me.</p>

<p>"A short time later I found that I was to become
a mother. I was happy then. I should
bear him a child. I told him of this. He suddenly
grew cold in his actions. Then he avoided
me. Disheartened I pleaded for him to marry
me. He laughed in my face and told me he had
never intended to do such a thing. I fainted
under this torrent of abuse.</p>

<p>"The thought that I had been cast aside nearly
cost me my reason. I knew I could not go home
in such a condition. I had heard that in Chicago
maternity hospitals were easy to enter, so one
night I packed some of my clothing and slipping
away from the hospital, boarded a train.</p>

<p>"I was frightened nearly out of my senses at
the enormity of my act. Across the aisle from
me in the railroad coach, sat an elderly woman.
Her face seemed kindly. After a few minutes'
ride, she smiled at me. Then when I vainly attempted
to smile back, she came over and sat
down beside me.</p>

<p>"She talked very motherly to me. Soon I had
told her my whole story. She was very sympathetic.
She said she pitied me in my trouble and
would help me. I clung to her as though she
were a mother. After we had talked some time,
she told me that she had a maiden aunt in Chicago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
at whose home I could live and that she
would see that I received proper medical attention.
I accepted her offer gratefully.</p>

<p>"When we reached Chicago she assisted me
with my baggage and into a waiting cab. For
some time we drove about the city.</p>

<p>"At last we arrived at a big stone mansion. It
was lighted almost from top to bottom.</p>

<p>"'Auntie must be entertaining tonight,'
laughed the woman. 'We'll go right in and to
our rooms. No one will see us.'</p>

<p>"A negro, attired in livery, came out and
carried our baggage in. We went at once to
rooms on the upper floor. I did not know where
I was. I believed what the elderly woman had
told me, that I was at the home of the aunt. It
was not until two weeks later that I found out
I was in this den of vice, where I now am.</p>

<p>"For those two weeks I was treated as well as
could be wished. Two elderly women came often
to see me and talked pleasantly. A doctor came
and attended me through my illness.</p>

<p>"I can't make you understand the shock that
came to me when they told me that I would have
no baby. The man and the two women had attended
to that. My baby was dead. There
seemed nothing else to live for.</p>

<p>"One morning when I had nearly recovered,
I got out of bed and went to the door. To my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
dismay I found that it was locked from the outside.
The windows were also locked. When the
women came a short time later I asked them
about it. They merely laughed and gave me no
answer.</p>

<p>"It was only a few nights later when I was
awakened by the sound of a man's voice. In the
darkness I could see him standing beside my bed.
I screamed and screamed but no one came. I
jumped out of bed and ran to the door. It was
securely locked. The man laughed at my efforts
to evade him.</p>

<p>"Finally he pressed a button on the wall. Two
women, dressed in short costumes that barely
reached to the knees, came into the room. The
man threw me on a bed and the two women held
me.</p>

<p>"After that I was given something to eat. Instantly
I seemed bereft of my senses. It was not
until a week later that I became normal again.
It was during that week that my ruin was forever
accomplished. Of what occurred I have but
a vague recollection.</p>

<p>"I realized then that I could never return home
again. I grew morose and sullen as I thought.
Often I tried to force myself to take my own life,
but the thoughts of my evil deeds kept me from
doing so.</p>

<p>"The days that passed were like the fancies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
a disordered mind. Gradually the atmosphere,
the viciousness of it seeped through me and took
the place of the innocence, the wifely feeling, the
mother love of which I had been robbed. The
process of degradation, of evolution into accepting
life in this prison came about swiftly. I
found myself accepting this home, this place
where I might exist.</p>

<p>"You know the verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Vice is a monster of so frightful mien<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As to be hated needs but to be seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet seen too oft, familiar with its face,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We first endure, then pity, then embrace.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"That describes my case. The owners of the
place gradually extended my liberties. I remember
the first day that came when they said I might
go out alone. They would trust me to come back.</p>

<p>"I had formulated a plan that morning. In
the Chicago papers I had seen a story telling of
the finding of a girl of about my age in the
waters of Lake Michigan, near Lincoln Park.
She did not have a coat or hat on and a portion
of her other clothing was missing.</p>

<p>"I went to a spot along the shore, near where
the body had been found. I took off my coat and
hat and soaked it in the water. I left a small
pocketbook with my name and a small amount of
money inside the coat pocket. Then I hurried
back to this place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"The clothing was found and turned over to
the police. The name and address were also
noted. My parents were notified. They came at
once to Chicago. The body of the girl had been
in the water for some time. They could not identify
it but easily identified the clothing.</p>

<p>"The body was taken home. I read of the terrible
grief of my parents with tearful eyes. I
read of my own burial. Often I knelt and
prayed for my sorrowing parents.</p>

<p>"Then I knew it was all over. To the world
I was dead. To myself my pure and innocent
life was a thing of the past. I had forever cut
off family ties. But to them I would forever be
known as the pure child that they knew and
loved.</p>

<p>"I have not associated with the women here
any more than I had to. I have never drank nor
smoked cigarettes, despite their attempts to force
me to do so.</p>

<p>"I have tried to imagine myself leading a different
life. I have gone to church and fancied
myself clothed with the purity and innocence of
the other days. Perhaps I turned my head to
look about me. Perhaps I heard a smothered exclamation
not meant for my ears. Mocking me,
driving me back to a realization of my degradation,
would be a face&mdash;the face of a man who had
come to the 'E&mdash;&mdash; Club' in search of a vent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
his beastly desires. He could do what I could
not and yet be respected. When I sought out a
place of worship, even he was ready to point a
mocking finger, to leer at me with an insulting
smile.</p>

<p>"In the theatres, in the parks, in the shopping
districts and on the streets of the city I have
tried, for just a little while, to imagine myself the
girl of the olden days. Always, everywhere, omnipresent
has been the reminder that drove me
back to the 'E&mdash;&mdash;' with a sigh of relief and a
sense of refuge. Can you understand?</p>

<p>"I have steeled myself to live this life because
there is no other left to me.</p>

<p>"I have hoped and prayed that I would not
live long, that I would grow ugly in features and
a person whom men would shun, but in vain. But
I know that sooner or later my hope will be realized."</p>

<p>"But I can help to save you. I can put you
in a position where you can earn a respectable
living and where you will be happy," pleaded the
reporter.</p>

<p>For a time the girl was in deep thought. When
she raised her head again her eyes were wet with
tears.</p>

<p>"I couldn't do it. I can never be anything else
now," she said. "Were I to take a position, it
would be but a question of time until some man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
who had seen me in this place would recognize
me. I would be discharged and driven into even
a deeper life of shame.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to even contemplate such a
thing.</p>

<p>"When a woman falls, she falls never to rise
again. The thoughts of her evil life are forever
a menace to her. They pursue her constantly.
She never can resume her former sphere in life."</p>

<p>"Isn't there anything that I can do to cause
you to come with me and do right?" asked the
reporter.</p>

<p>"There is nothing that anyone can do. What
I am now I will always be," she replied.</p>

<p>"Won't you at least meet me away from this
awful place and try to spend at least part of your
evenings in the respectable way to which you
were accustomed?" was asked.</p>

<p>"I will meet you where no one would recognize
either you or I," was the reply. "I would
not disgrace you by having anyone know me.</p>

<p>"You will not meet the little girl you knew,
though. Henceforth you must meet a fallen
woman, a woman who sells her flesh, pound by
pound, to human vultures. You had best change
your mind. For myself, I would be delighted to
be with you, but the old memories are painful.
I will see you but you must never come here for
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>When the reporter left the sin-cursed place,
there were tears in his eyes. To him it was as
though he were deserting his own sister to the
ravages of a pack of wolves.</p>

<p>Half a block away from the place he paused
in deep thought. Should he go at once to her
parents and tell them of the finding of their
daughter, that she was alive?</p>

<p>He knew they would gladly receive her back,
that any and all of her wrongs would be overlooked.
He thought of their great love for her,
of their deep grief in her death.</p>

<p>But as he thought, he could see a fireside in a
city but a few hundred miles distant. Side by
side sat a couple. The man was a personage
slightly bent, as though bowed down with some
grief in the middle of life. The woman's hair was
tinged with gray. Her motherly face was lit by
a radiant smile, as though she were dreaming of
something heavenly.</p>

<p>He could see them clasp hands and sit for
hours dreaming of the happiness of but a few
months before. Then the father would rise, and,
walking across the room, caress some tiny trinket,
such as gladdens the heart of a girl. He
would pick up a picture, that of a beautiful,
laughing girl, radiant in the innocence of the unknowing
girl. Long he would gaze at it. Then
imprinting a kiss on the face of the picture, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
would lay it carefully back in its place. They
were happy in the thought that their child was
in a better world&mdash;of that fact they had no doubt.</p>

<p>The reporter's mind was quickly made up.</p>

<p>"It is better so," he half muttered. "It is better
so."</p>

<p>Slowly he retraced his steps past the den where
he had found her. An automobile had just come
to a stop at the curb. Several well dressed men,
in the last stages of intoxication, staggered from
the car. Swearing and cursing, they mounted
the steps of the house. The door was opened to
admit them. From the house came the wild
scream of a drunken woman mingled with the
coarser yells of drunken men.</p>

<p>Then the door closed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Tragedy of the "Want Ad."</span></p>


<p>In April, 1909, a peculiarly worded advertisement
appeared in the personal columns of the
Chicago Daily News and the Chicago Tribune.
It was worded as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Traveling Companion</span>: Widow preparing
for extended tour of Europe wants to engage
young lady as traveling companion and secretary.
Must be young, beautiful, fascinating and
accomplished. All expenses and suitable salary.
Z 14, Tribune.</p>

<p>The advertisement was what is known in newspaper
parlance as a "blind" or keyed ad. It did
not give any street address, letters of application
being sent to the newspaper and there held for
the advertiser.</p>

<p>A young Chicago girl read the advertisement
and answered it. In her letter of application
she said that she had been called beautiful by her
friends, that she spoke several languages, that
she was convent bred and that she had previously
traveled extensively. She also stated her age,
which was 22.</p>

<p>The girl inclosed her address in the letter and
said that, if considered favorably, she would be
pleased to call upon the "widow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The young Chicago girl was all that she declared
herself to be. Her beauty was a matter
beyond dispute. Her charm of manner and her
accomplishments were on a plane with her innocence
and purity.</p>

<p>The day following the mailing of the letter a
caller was announced at the young lady's home.
The caller was an elderly woman. She was dressed
in black. Her adornment was rich. It bespoke
an apparent command of wealth. The woman's
language and general demeanor was that of
marked social standing. She gave her name as
"Schwartz."</p>

<p>To the young girl she made known the fact
that she was the authoress of the advertisement
which the young lady had answered in the papers.
She said that her home was in southern California.
She said that her husband had been a very
wealthy resident of California and that most of
her life had been spent in her own home. She
said her husband had died a few months before,
leaving her alone with no relatives and practically
no friends in the world.</p>

<p>"I have always been a home body," she said.
"My life was wrapped up in my home and my
husband. When he died there seemed nothing
else on earth to live for. God did not see fit to
bless us with children. The death of my husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
left me prostrated. The first illness of my
life came then. Doctors told me that unless I
sought a change in travel that I might drag out
many long years alone as an invalid.</p>

<p>"I have all the money I know what to do with.
When the physicians told me to leave the scene
of my sorrows, and to leave at once, I packed
hurriedly and departed from Los Angeles. I
have had no time to think until I reached Chicago.</p>

<p>"Now that I am here I have realized that I
must have a companion for reasons that you can
very easily understand. I do not want an old
person about me. It was the thought of the
mental diversion that caused me to advertise for
a young and vivacious girl. At the same time I
must have some one who knows how to travel,
how to attend to the endless details that travel
involves. That is why your letter came to me as
a godsend."</p>

<p>The widow wiped her eyes softly with a bordered
handkerchief. To the innocent young girl
she seemed the picture of grief. A little while
was passed in conversation of a general nature.
As the widow rose to go she said, "I like you.
You seem to me the ideal of such a companion as
I would have. The only question to be settled
is whether or not you will like me.</p>

<p>"If you will come with me as my little daughter
I can assure you that you will want for nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
I will dress you as I would my own daughter.
We shall visit the world. I have already
prepared to engage passage for Europe and desire
to sail Saturday, four days from today.</p>

<p>"In order that you may satisfy yourself as to
whether or not you will like me I want you to
call at my hotel tonight and take dinner with me.
I am living at the Arena hotel, 1340 Michigan
avenue. A quiet, retired little place."</p>

<p>"I will be delighted," said the girl. "I don't
think that there is any question as to whether or
not I will like you. You have charmed me already.
I am alone in Chicago. The only relative
I have here is my brother. He will be pleased
I know to hear that there is such a pleasant occupation
in store for me."</p>

<p>The widow paused in her going, as women do.
The conversation prattled on. The girl spoke of
her brother and, before she knew it, she was saying:</p>

<p>"I never take any steps without consulting him.
He knows so much. I would love to bring him
with me to meet you tonight, if you wouldn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her sentence was arrested by the cloud that
passed over the widow's face. It was a look,
sharp, keen, bitter, hard as a look can be. Even
the girl, unwise as she was in the study of human
nature and the ways of the world, felt an intuitive
thrill that bordered on suspicion. She didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
finish her sentence exactly as she had meant to.
Instead, she said: "In fact my brother would
hardly let me go, you know, without first meeting
you himself and talking with you. You can understand."</p>

<p>Quickly as it took to say it, the woman in black
recovered her self-composure. Before the girl
had finished she was all asmile.</p>

<p>"You dear child," she said, holding out her
hand, "I'm so glad to hear you say that. Indeed,
I couldn't think of taking you away from him
without having him feel certain in his heart that
it would be for your good. I'd love to have him
call with you tonight. You'll both dine with me,
of course. Do you remember my address?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again a peculiar look came over the widow's
face. This time it was not hard, not sharp, not
of dismay nor apprehension, but a sly, fox-like,
satisfied smile that the girl afterwards remembered
and understood.</p>

<p>"I'll just write it down for you," said the widow.
"I'll give you the street number, too, so
that you won't forget. Pardon me, I haven't a
card."</p>

<p>The girl produced a slip of paper and a lead
pencil. On the card the widow wrote:</p>

<p>"HOTEL IROQUOIS, 3035 Michigan avenue."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>And then Mrs. Schwartz departed.</p>

<p>When the girl's brother arrived at home an
hour or so later he found a sister bounding with
joy, bubbling with excess of spirits.</p>

<p>The brother was a man of the world. He knew,
as a cosmopolitan must know, of the guile and
trickery and fraud and deceit that a great city
contains. Yet, when the girl told him the story
of the California widow and her desire to hire
a traveling companion at an enormous salary,
he doubted it not. His spirits were equally as
high as his little sister's when he dressed for
the trip to the Iroquois hotel. It was a smiling
young couple that tripped into the lobby of the
hotel an hour or so later and asked the clerk to
notify Mrs. Schwartz that her guests were awaiting
her pleasure.</p>

<p>"Schwartz?" said the clerk, as he glanced over
the room book a second time. "No such person
of that name here. Sure you got the name right?"</p>

<p>The girl produced the slip of paper in the widow's
own handwriting:</p>

<p class="center">
"Margaret Schwartz,<br />
Iroquois hotel, 3035 Michigan avenue."<br />
</p>

<p>"Maybe we've transcribed the name wrong
from the register," said the clerk. "Where is she
from?"</p>

<p>"Los Angeles, California," said the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nobody been here from Los Angeles since
December, when we put in this new register,"
said the clerk after running over the pages.</p>

<p>The tears that came to the young girl's eyes
were tears of mortification, of bitter dismay. Her
only thought was that she had been made the victim
of some peculiar person's idea of a practical
joke. It was not until the two were back in
their own apartments that the girl remembered
vaguely the conversation of the widow and the
woman's peculiar starts.</p>

<p>"Charlie," she said to her brother, "that woman
told me a different hotel at first. It was the
Aree&mdash;, Areen&mdash;, the Arena hotel, that she told
me first. She asked me to go there first. She
CHANGED THE NAME WHEN I TOLD
HER I WOULD BRING YOU WITH
ME!"</p>

<p>"Hell!" said the brother. And there was a
look on his face such as Cain must have worn
when he committed the first murder.</p>

<p>"Why?" you ask, in astonishment. The answer
is to be found on the police blotters of the
Harrison street station.</p>

<p>The Arena hotel, at Thirteenth and Michigan,
is the most notorious, the most terrible assignation
house in the city of Chicago. When honest
men are in bed the red lights of the Arena glare
onto the boulevard like the bloodshot eyes of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
devouring dragon. The gilded sons of fortune
tear up before its yawning doors in their high
powered motor cars. The keys to the doors were
thrown away long ago. Without it is dismal
and somber. Within it is pallid with the erotic
gleam of many incandescents. Its music is the
popping of champagne corks, the laughter of
wine debauched women, the raucous roars of the
huntsmen&mdash;huntsmen whose sole sport is the
slaughter of the innocent, whose only game is the
chastity of the maiden. A ten dollar bill is necessary
for the purchase of the meanest private
dining room in the Arena for a night of revelry.
There is not a private dining room in the place
without a bedroom in comfortable proximity.</p>

<p>The hoi polloi, the common herd, is not admitted
at the Arena. To enter there you must be
known, and you must be known as a spender.</p>

<p>The price of food is treble that of any other
place. The cost of liquors is double that of many.
The Arena is the sporting ground of the rich.
And sport in the Arena comes high.</p>

<p>The brother of the young girl in question determined
to probe the widow and her mystery to
the bottom. He determined, in the first place,
to give her the benefit of doubt despite his own
convictions. He went to a telephone and called
the Arena hotel. He asked for "Mrs. Schwartz."
A woman answered the call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is Mr. &mdash;&mdash;," he said. "I believe you
called upon my sister today."</p>

<p>"What is that?" the woman's voice answered.
"Who are you? You must be mistaken. Who
do you think you are talking to?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Schwartz, isn't it?"</p>

<p>There was a moment of hesitation. The man
imagined it a moment of confusion. And then
the voice answered: "Oh, no, this is Miss Gartz.
You are talking to the wrong person." A mocking
laugh and a click of the receiver announced
to the man that he had been rung off.</p>

<p>He called up the Arena again. He asked for
Mrs. Schwartz. He was told that there was no
such person there. He asked the clerk for Miss
Gartz again. The man was sorry, but Miss
Gartz had just left. Repeated telephone calls
for both Mrs. Schwartz and Miss Gartz were answered
in succeeding days with the information
that there were no such persons there. Miss Gartz
was not on the hotel register. Neither was Mrs.
Schwartz.</p>

<p>The brother of the young Chicago girl went to
the offices of the Chicago Tribune and the Daily
News and asked for the name of the woman who
inserted the "Traveling Companion" advertisement.
He was told that the papers were sorry,
but that would be impossible. The clerks who
had charge of the want ads were under bonds to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
divulge no information regarding blind advertisements.
They could not tell who inserted
them, anyway, as no names were taken. The
letters when received by the newspapers were
held until the advertisers called for them. The
newspapers could not maintain the integrity of
their advertising columns if they asked impertinent
questions of every advertiser.</p>

<p>The newspaper men were sorry. No one regretted
the creeping into their columns of such
matter so much as they. Both papers employed
detectives to scrutinize the want columns and to
hunt down and expurgate such advertising if the
least possible suspicion was attached to it, but
many want ads were so cleverly and innocently
worded that they would creep in despite every
possible precaution that might be taken.</p>

<p>The young man employed detectives himself.
He went to a large agency and told the manager
the circumstances. Hardened as he was through
constant association with crime and its varied
phases, the manager of the agency winced when
the story was finished.</p>

<p>"You've saved your sister from a living hell,"
said the crime expert. "You've saved her from
the most terrible spider that ever wove a net for
the accomplishment of ruin. 'Mrs. Schwartz'
the widow, is a procuress&mdash;the most clever and
fiendish procuress known to us. She works under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
a hundred aliases. So keen is she, so clever
in her plots to bring about the ruin of young
girls, that we can not cope with her. She is a
rich woman. Every dollar that she has made
represents a soul blackened, an innocent metamorphosed
into a drug sotted, degraded creature
of the red lights.</p>

<p>"Your sister is not the only girl that advertisement
was meant for. It probably has already
written the ruin of a score of beautiful young
innocents. It was a lure. A lure only. There
was no trip to Europe. There was no trip
planned to any place except a house in Twenty-second
street or the private chambers of some
wealthy libertine.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Schwartz must have received many hundred
answers to that advertisement from young
girls all over the city&mdash;even out of the city. The
glamour of a trip to Europe, a salary to tour the
world, would turn any young girl's head. The
wording of the advertisement would arouse no
fears or suspicions in the mind of even a worldly
wise person.</p>

<p>"When Mrs. Schwartz called upon your sister
and proposed that she take dinner with her at her
hotel she wanted the girl to go alone. When the
girl accepted, Mrs. Schwartz named the Arena
because she could accomplish her purpose there.
It was the after-thought of the girl's that saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
her and covered Mrs. Schwartz with confusion.
She wrote down the name of the Hotel Iroquois
for the express purpose of destroying the recollection
of the Arena in the girl's mind. The Hotel
Iroquois is a quiet family hotel of good reputation.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Schwartz, as she calls herself, knew that
the game was up when your sister mentioned you.
Daring and bold as she is, she knows better than
to try her wits with a man.</p>

<p>"Had the girl accepted the invitation without
mentioning your name the stage would have been
set for her reception at the Arena. I doubt if
the proprietors of the place would have known
anything about this. The Arena is an assignation
house, not a brothel. Had the girl gone to
the Arena alone she would have been sent to the
apartments which Mrs. Schwartz would have
taken for her reception. She would have been
plied with flattery, smothered with blandishments.
Her little head would have been turned with compliments.
At the psychological instant dinner
would have been served. Dinner would include
wine. Did the girl refuse to touch wine despite
the subtle invitations and arts of the widow, her
food and her water would have been 'doctored.'</p>

<p>"Mrs. Schwartz is an adept in the gentle art of
administering drugs. In less than an hour the
innocent child would have been in the throes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
delirium, wild, drunk, robbed of her morality
through the insidiousness of the widow's dope.</p>

<p>"Then the man would have been introduced.
The scene would have changed from the little
private dining room to the adjoining bedroom."</p>

<p>The young man shuddered, and shut his eyes
as if to close out the picture. The big detective
went on, mercilessly:</p>

<p>"The widow Schwartz and her male accomplice
would have rejoiced in their triumph as the drugged
innocent was robbed of her chastity.</p>

<p>"Give the widow Schwartz two hours and the
end would have been written. Then to call a cab,
carry the unconscious child out of the Arena,
bundle her off to the market place and sell her for
one hundred&mdash;two hundred&mdash;five hundred&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" said the young man.</p>

<p>After an interval he said, "I put my possessions,
such as they are, at your disposal. I want
you to trap this woman. I want you to catch
her. Surely you can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Catch her? Maybe. We'll try." The detective
pressed a button.</p>

<p>"Send in Miss B&mdash;&mdash;," he said.</p>

<p>A young woman returned with the messenger.
She did not look like a detective. A young girl
she was, of good figure, of pleasant countenance.
Her eyes were large and striking. The detective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
held out a copy of the "Traveling Companion"
want ad for her perusal.</p>

<p>"Miss B&mdash;&mdash;," he said, "the woman who inserted
that advertisement is a procuress. The
ad is a lure. Will you be willing to take this
case? If so, I want you to write an answer on
delicate stationery. Give your address as your
home. Say that you are 'convent bred,' beautiful,
alone in the world through a tragedy that
wiped out both your relatives and your fortune,
that you are young, talented, a mistress of repartee,
anything that will tantalize that woman and
convince her. Then, if the trout takes the fly,
you will have to go to this woman's apartments
alone, let her drug you and trust to us to be on
hand for the climax. I do not ask you to take
this case unless it is of your own volition."</p>

<p>The girl hesitated. When she answered it was
to say that she would not only take it, but, were
it necessary, she would take it without pay.</p>

<p>"I will inclose my photograph with the letter,"
she said. "My photographs make me appear far
more beautiful than I really am."</p>

<p>Both letter and photograph were mailed. To
make sure as to whether or not it was too late the
detectives called up the newspapers and were told
that the advertisement was "paid in advance to
run until Saturday."</p>

<p>The letter, a cunningly and alluringly worded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
missive, was mailed to the newspaper office. The
photograph, which betokened a ravishing little
beauty, was inclosed. Shadow men were posted
at the newspaper offices to follow the woman
when she called for her mail.</p>

<p>Wednesday passed. Thursday, Friday and
Sunday came with no response. At the newspaper
offices the publishers said there were more
than 200 letters awaiting the pleasure of the
woman who wanted a "traveling companion."
Yet the advertiser neglected to call for her mail.</p>

<p>When convinced that there would be no answer
the woman operator went to the Arena to call
for Mrs. Schwartz. She was told that there was
no such person there.</p>

<p>The wary old spider, bold enough when maneuvering
the enslavement of innocent girls, had
fled to cover at the first alarm.</p>

<p>"We'll have to give it up," said the detective
to the young man. "She's skipped to different
quarters. She's scheming out some new bait.
Schwartz her real name? She probably has a
thousand names. A different alias for every girl
she marks as a victim."</p>

<p>Do you want to investigate this story for yourself?
Do you want corroborative evidence? The
writer of this book has affidavits from the principals
as to its truth. The want columns of any
great metropolitan daily will supply material for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
your investigations. Look for the "chorus girls
wanted" ads. Look for the "roommates" ads.
Peruse the personal advertisements. Look
through the column headed "Wanted, Female
Help, Miscellaneous." Once in a while you'll
read an innocent little paragraph that is sending
young virgins to the slaughter pens and the slave
marts. Mrs. Schwartz is not the only woman in
the business.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Tragedy of the Assignation House.</span></p>


<p>Her name can be read a quarter of a mile
away from the big electric signs in front of a
Broadway theater today. A year ago it was
emblazoned from the signboards of a Chicago
amusement place. A few years before that it
was hardly known outside the little Springfield
cottage of the maiden lady with whom she made
her home. Truth to tell, she doesn't know her
real name, and the title she goes by as a theatrical
star is the only one she has. For she is an
orphan girl and she was taken to rear by the two
elderly maiden ladies in Springfield, Illinois,
when she was a cooing, gob-gobbing baby in an
orphan asylum. But that, as Kipling says, has
nothing to do with this narrative.</p>

<p>If you are fortunate enough to enjoy the hospitality
of her dressing-room, between the acts,
you will notice the loving tones she uses in addressing
her maid. An oldish woman is the maid,
whose face betokens fading beauty, whose supple
limbs echo of some stage experience of bygone
days.</p>

<p>And if you are of that rare type that begets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
ready confidence the maid will tell you the story
as it is set down here:</p>

<p>"Yes, I was a show girl myself," says the maid,
"and I wasn't any ham-fatter, either, although
I'm broken down now and worth nothing save as
a mother to 'Madge.' I lost my ambition long
ago. I haven't any now save to see my mistress
the greatest leading lady in the land, which she
will be if the gracious Master of our destinies
spares her long enough.</p>

<p>"It's strange how the fates threw us together.
You may have wondered why she treats me like a
sister actress and an equal, and why I never say,
'Yes, ma'am,' and, 'No, ma'am,' to her. But
God's good to me and He put it in my way to
bring her to what she is today instead of being
one of those poor beings what's referred to as
'white slaves' in the papers, bless your soul.</p>

<p>"She ain't been on the stage long. But she's
made good use of every hour since she's been in
the business. She ain't at all like these lobster-loving,
champagne-sipping ones you read about.
Not a bit of it. See them pictures?"</p>

<p>The maid pointed to a group of photographs
hanging 'round the room. Remarkable they
were, in that every picture bore the shining face
of a Madonna, a mother and a babe.</p>

<p>"That's the kind of a girl Madge is. Loves
babies, dreams about 'em, has but one ideal, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
that to have a little home of her own and a group
of prattlers. She'll have 'em, too, and she'll quit
this business if she ever finds a man in this world
good enough for her, which there ain't.</p>

<p>"Lord bless me, how it was I found her. She
didn't know anything outside of Springfield and
the legislature and 'Uncle Dave,' who was a member
of the senate, or something, and who boarded
with the maiden ladies when the legislature sat.
Uncle Dave was called uncle chiefly because he
wasn't. He was a big, fat man with a hollow
talk like yelling in a rain barrel and a laugh that
shook his balloon style figure like a dish of jelly.
Seemed to be a pretty fine specimen of an old
gentleman. Used to play with Madge and tease
her and chuck her under the chin and give her the
kind of advice you read about in the Old Woman's
Journal.</p>

<p>"So when the day came that the stock investments
the old ladies had made went bust and the
two dears cried and Madge made 'em 'fess up
that there wasn't enough to feed three mouths
now, not to speak of two, Madge just up and
told 'em that she was coming to Chicago to earn
her own living. She wasn't going to be any burden.
And she done it. She started instanter.
Uncle Dave said he'd look out for her&mdash;he lives
in Chicago. And, sure enough, he was there to
meet her at the train when it reached the depot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Madge, the little dear, didn't know enough to
ask a policeman. She wouldn't have known what
to do if it wasn't for Uncle Dave. He just bundled
her into a cab and gave an order and then he
told her that he was taking her to a nice place at
his hotel which he had fixed up for her. And he
took her to a place on Wabash avenue and he
ordered something that was brought up by a
nigger. And he told her to drink it&mdash;she who
didn't know whisky or dope from lemon pop.</p>

<p>"And then the old bugger sits right down and
says they must write a letter to Madge's aunts
and tell them how nice she is fixed and how they
mustn't worry about her being 'lost in the great
city,' or words to that effect. And Uncle Dave
puts in something about getting her a nice position
which will keep her very busy and they
mustn't worry if she doesn't write every day.</p>

<p>"He goes out to mail the letter, and Madge
lies down, because her head gets dizzy. And
when she wakes up it's dark and she feels so
funny. Then the little dear remembers that
she's got to be brave and mustn't get lonely or
homesick, even if the beautiful big room she's got
doesn't seem so snug and cozy as her little dormer
bedroom under the roof in the cottage at home.</p>

<p>"So she lets down her beautiful golden hair
and starts to sing. And me, what's been an old
sport and no good to nobody, myself included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
most of all, is in that same hotel. I'm not making
any excuses for my presence. But when I
hears that golden voice floating through the corridors
of that den of iniquity I just ups and
chokes plumb up, and not thinkin' of the proprieties
or anything else, I just beats it to that
door and looks for the owner of the voice.</p>

<p>"And when I sees that beautiful baby girl, her
red hair hanging to the floor, her big eyes lookin'
at me so innocent-like, I ups and puts it to her
straight.</p>

<p>"'F'r God's sake,' says I, 'child, what are you
doing here?'</p>

<p>"'Minding my own business,' she should have
said. But she ain't got that kind of a heart in
her. Instead she ups and tells me in the most
innocent way about Uncle Dave and Springfield
and the two maiden aunts what weren't aunts at
all, but just foster mothers to one child. And
she tells me how Uncle Dave has brought her to
this lovely place to live and is going to get her a
job.</p>

<p>"'Job, hell,' I busts out, and she blushes and
looks scared. Don't you know this is the &mdash;&mdash;
hotel, the most terrible assignation house in
this big, rotten old burg, where other girls like
you, Margaret Burkle, for instance, were taken
by designing old villains, kidnapped, enslaved
and robbed of their virtue and their innocence?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"At that she looks bewildered, as if she don't
understand, and I didn't have the nerve to draw
a map for her, knowin' as I did that I might have
a mess of lively young hysteria on my hands. But
I just puts my hand on her head and tells her to
'Never mind,' and then I slips out and shuts the
door.</p>

<p>"I calls a bellboy who has got some money in
tips for drinks and other things from my room
and I asks him to slip down to the office and see
who's registered for room 346. I knew I couldn't
find out, as the foxy proprietors of this rotten old
dump don't keep a regular book register, but a
card index, so that they can tear up a card easy
and destroy it in case any angry husband or irate
wife tries to drag them into the divorce courts
with evidence.</p>

<p>"The boy beats it downstairs and comes back
in double quick time, owin' possibly to some extent
to the big four bit piece I slipped into his
hand. I waits for him to say something, and
when he said it I wouldn't have had to ask him,
for I knew it in advance.</p>

<p>"'It's John Brown and wife,' he tells me, winkin'
solemn and wise-like.</p>

<p>"'That'll do for you,' I tells him. Then I
don't waste no time, but jump into my clothes
and beat it for that little girl with the auburn
hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"'You come with me&mdash;pack up an' git,' I tells
her.</p>

<p>"'Why, what, but Uncle Dave&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'T'ell with Uncle Dave,' says I, not feeling
sanctimonious; 'hustle up now.'</p>

<p>"The little dear looks kind of bewildered, but
I'm feelin' so proud and bully in my heart to see
that she's trustin' me and doin' as I say. I bundles
her out of the dump fast as I can do it and
just as we reaches the door up rushes a big, fat,
apoplectic old Santy Claus and blusters:</p>

<p>"'Here, you, where you going with that girl?'</p>

<p>"'Say, you cradle robbing old pork barrel,
back stage for you in a hurry or I'll sic the dangle
wagon onto you. Skidoo now and no back talk,
or I'll read about you in the morning papers with
great eclat,' I says.</p>

<p>"He does a little Swiss yodle or something
back in his throat and then he notices a big boy
in a blue suit swingin' a piece of mahogany comin'
our way and he don't stop to tip his hat.</p>

<p>"The little dear don't understand it all, but
she's bright, if unsophisticated, and I could have
just hugged her right there on the street for
trusting me in comparison to him, as smug and
sleek as Father O'Hara, though that's as far as
the comparison goes.</p>

<p>"I takes the little darling over to the North
Side with me to the home of a fine little actor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
his wife, who are more for real home than they
are for the gay life. And they don't ask no
questions, but just take her right in to their
hearthside.</p>

<p>"Little Madge was too proud for them,
though, even if she had been an orphan and allowed
herself to be given a home when she was
too small to work and didn't know how to beg,
much less spurn any charity.</p>

<p>"She goes out every day to look for work. She
don't find anybody that wants to hire a girl in a
made-over alpaca and clodhopper shoes, though
her form and figure is something you don't see
in them automobiles that whizz up and down on
the boulevards.</p>

<p>"She tries to get into a show company, being
of that temperament and having a real voice, and
she has some narrow escapes from bumping up
against fake booking agencies that would have
sold her into the same kind of a gilded palace of
sin Uncle Dave had cooked up for her.</p>

<p>"One day, when she's walking on State street,
so shoddy that her little bare feet are touching
the pavement through the holes in her soles, she
sees a big sign and the wigs in the windows of
Burnham's hair store.</p>

<p>"She goes in there. A clerk steps up to her,
kind of smart-like, and she almost bowls him over.
She just reached up, pulls out a couple of pins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
takes off her hat and down drops a regular Niagara
of Titian tinted tresses.</p>

<p>"'How much for this?' she asks him.</p>

<p>"He just gasps and goes back to tell it all to
Mr. Burnham, and that individual comes out and
dickers with her right then and there for the purchase
of her crown of glory.</p>

<p>"She got sixteen dollars an ounce&mdash;a big, fat
bank roll. She reinvests some of it for enough
false hair to make her look all right and then she
goes over to one of the big stores and buys the
kind of clothes that nobody knows how to wear
like her.</p>

<p>"It's the most stunning little beauty in the
world that comes home that night. With her
clothes and her beauty she don't have no trouble
at all to make an engagement. Those two maiden
aunts are living in a little bungalow that she's
built for them out in a suburb of Chicago today;
and me&mdash;I'm on the job right here just as you
see me.</p>

<p>"Uncle Dave? He turned up&mdash;not so many
days ago. And he has the pneumogastric to try
to chuckle her under the chin just like he used to
in Springfield. And she don't say a word.</p>

<p>"She just turns white as a bit of powdered
chalk. I catches her as she keels over. I holds
her with one hand. With the other I sticks a
hatpin into Uncle Dave where it will do the most
good."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Tragedy of the Immigrant Girl.</span></p>


<p>In the musty old records of United States District
Attorney Edwin W. Sims, in the federal
building, is written the story of the tragedy of a
little Italian peasant girl.</p>

<p>The story is similar in many details to the stories
told to Mr. Sims and his assistant, Harry
Parkin, by more than 200 black-haired, sloe-eyed
beauties from sunny Italy. They had all been
imported, brought through the underground railroad
of the white slaver, over the Canadian border,
down the St. Claire river, through the great
lakes and into Chicago.</p>

<p>Whether these hunters of the innocent ply
their awful calling at home or abroad, their methods
are much the same&mdash;with the exception that
the foreign girl is more hopelessly at their mercy.</p>

<p>The story of the tragedy of this little Italian
peasant girl, who helped her father till the soil
in the vineyards and fields near Naples, is but one
of many of similar character, but it is expressive.
She was a beautiful little creature. Her form
was that of a Venus&mdash;her great mass of black
hair hung in a dense cloud from her shapely head.
One might picture her, before she was enticed
into the terrible life of shame, as a little queen
among the women of her race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet when she was brought into the district attorney's
office, having been one of a number of
aliens captured in a raid by federal authorities
on immoral dives in South Chicago, she was a
mass of scars. Her eyes had lost their deep expressive
quality. Her nerves seemed to be
wrecked.</p>

<p>When she was brought into what the sensational
newspapers would call the "sweat box" it
was clear that she was in a state of abject terror.
She stoutly maintained that she had been in this
country for more than three years and that she
was in a life of shame from choice and not
through the criminal act of any person.</p>

<p>She attempted to tell how she had come to
this country alone, but was unable to tell the
name of the steamship on which she had crossed
the ocean or how she had reached Chicago. In
broken English she said that she had been in a
house of ill repute in New York before coming
to Chicago and that she had received the scars
on her face through an old injury that had happened
years before.</p>

<p>Assistant District Attorney Parkin, however,
was not convinced. He asked her several questions
in quick succession. To all of them she
quickly answered "three years."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the length of time immigrants must be
in this country before they may be picked up and
deported as aliens.</p>

<p>It was this answer that convinced him that the
girl had been cowed into submission and
"schooled" by her procurers under threats. It
was through this answer that the white slavers
rested their hope that the girl's story would be
believed and that they would be safe from criminal
prosecution.</p>

<p>Soon, however, the assistant district attorney
convinced her that he and his associates were her
friends and protectors and that their purpose
was to punish those who had profited by her ruin
and to send her back to her Italian home with all
her expenses paid; that she was under the protection
of the United States and was as safe as if
the King of Italy should take her under his royal
care and pledge his word that her enemies should
not have revenge upon her.</p>

<p>Then she broke down and related her awful
narrative. That every word of it is true no one
could doubt who saw her as she told it.</p>

<p>A "fine lady," who wore beautiful clothes,
came to where she lived with her parents. She
made friends with every one. Money seemed of
no object to her. She lavished it upon the young
girls of the district and flattered them. She told
the young immigrant girl that she was uncommonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
pretty and professed a great interest in
her. Such flattering attentions from an American
lady, who wore clothes as fine as those of the
Italian nobility, could have but one effect on the
mind of the simple little peasant girl and her still
simpler parents. Their heads were completely
turned and they regarded the American lady almost
with adoration.</p>

<p>Very shrewdly the woman did not attempt to
bring the little girl back with her, but held out
the hope that some day a letter might come with
money for her passage to America. Once there
she would become the companion of her American
friend and they would have great times together.</p>

<p>Of course, in due time, the money came&mdash;and
the $100 was a most substantial pledge to the
parents of the wealth and generosity of the
"American lady." Unhesitatingly she was prepared
for the voyage which was to take her to the
land of happiness and good fortune. According
to the arrangements made by letter the girl was
met at New York by two "friends" of her benefactress,
who attended to her entrance papers
and took her in charge. These "friends" were
two of the most brutal of all the white slave
drivers who are in the traffic. At this time she
was about sixteen years old, innocent and rarely
attractive for a girl of her class, having the large,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
handsome eyes, the black hair and the rich olive
skin of a typical Italian.</p>

<p>Where these two men took her she did not
know&mdash;but by the most violent and brutal means
they quickly accomplished her ruin. For a week
she was subjected to unspeakable treatment and
made to feel that her degradation was complete
and final.</p>

<p>And here let it be said that the breaking of the
spirit, the crushing of all hope for any future
save that of shame, is always a part of the initiation
of a white slave. Then the girl was shipped
to Chicago, where she was disposed of to the
keeper of an Italian dive of the vilest type. On
her entrance here she was furnished with gaudy
dresses and wearing apparel for which the Keeper
of the place charged her $600. As is the case
with all new white slaves, she was not allowed to
have any clothing which she could wear upon the
street.</p>

<p>Her one object in life was to escape from the
den in which she was held a prisoner. To "pay
out" seemed the surest way, and at length, from
her wages of shame, she was able to cancel the
$600 account. Then she asked for her street
clothing and her release&mdash;only to be told that she
had incurred other expenses to the amount of
$400.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Her Italian blood took fire at this and she
made a dash for liberty. But she was not quite
quick enough and the hand of the oppressor was
upon her. In the wild scene that followed she
was slashed with a razor, one gash straight
through her right eye, one across her cheek and
another slitting her ear. Then she was given
medical attention and the wounds gradually
healed, but her face is horribly mutilated, her
right eye is always open and to look upon her is
to shudder.</p>

<p>When the raids began she was secreted and arrangements
made to ship her to a dive in the
mining regions of the west. Fortunately, however,
a few hours before she was to start upon her
journey the United States marshals raided the
place and captured herself as well as her keepers.
To add to the horror of her situation she became
a mother. The awful thought in her mind, however,
is to escape from assassination at the hands
of the murderous gang which oppressed her.</p>

<p>This is only one of a score of similar cases discovered
by the authorities.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to say that the legal evidence
thus far collected establishes with complete
moral certainty these awful facts: That the white
slave traffic is a system&mdash;a syndicate which has
its ramifications from the Atlantic seaboard to
the Pacific ocean, with "clearing houses" or "distributing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
centers" in nearly all of the larger
cities; that in this ghastly traffic the buying price
of a young girl is $15 and that the selling price
is generally about $200&mdash;if the girl is especially
attractive the white slave dealer may be able to
sell her for $400 or $600; that this syndicate did
not make less than $200,000 last year in this almost
unthinkable commerce; that it is a definite
organization sending its hunters regularly to
scour France, Germany, Hungary, Italy and
Canada for victims; that the man at the head of
this unthinkable enterprise is known among his
hunters as "The Big Chief."</p>

<p>Also the evidence shows that the hirelings of
this traffic are stationed at certain ports of entry
in Canada where large numbers of immigrants
are landed to do what is known in their parlance
as "cutting out work." In other words, these
watchers for human prey scan the immigrants as
they come down the gangplank of a vessel which
has just arrived and "spot" the girls who are unaccompanied
by fathers, mothers, brothers or relatives
to protect them. The girl who has been
spotted as a desirable and unprotected victim is
promptly approached by a man who speaks her
language and is immediately offered employment
at good wages, with all expenses to the destination
to be paid by the man. Most frequently
laundry work is the bait held out, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
housework or employment in a candy shop or
factory.</p>

<p>The object of the negotiations is to "cut out"
the girl from any of her associates and to get her
to go with him. Then the only thing is to accomplish
their ruin by the shortest route. If they
cannot be cajoled or enticed by promises of an
easy time, plenty of money, fine clothes and the
usual stock of allurements&mdash;or a fake marriage&mdash;then
harsher methods are resorted to. In some
instances the hunters really marry the victims. As
to the sterner measures, it is, of course, impossible
to speak explicitly beyond the statement that
intoxication and drugging are often used as a
means to reduce the victims to a state of helplessness
and sheer physical violence is a common
thing.</p>

<p>When the United States authorities some time
ago raided the French resorts on the south side
in search of foreign born victims of the slave
trade, some of the most palpable of slavery tactics
were discovered.</p>

<p>"Not one woman in one of these prominent resorts
was found who could speak English," said
Assistant United States Attorney Parkin. "But
in their own tongue everything said by them
showed long drilling as to answers that should
be made to inquiries. Ask any one of these women
a sudden question in English and her reply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
to anything asked would be 'five years,' the term
of residence in the United States that would prevent
deportation.</p>

<p>"The typical story of the women was of having
come to New York about four years ago as
companions or servants in the family of well to
do French immigrants. After several years the
family had returned, leaving the girl, who about
three or four months before had come to Chicago
from a New York resort.</p>

<p>"But the slavery feature was bulwarked by
every fact that we could elicit from these drilled
women. Not one of them knew by what steamer
she had come to the country; she could not even
name the line by which she sailed. She didn't
know what the steamer fares were. She could
not name a single street in New York, which
would have been a certainty had she even stopped
there for a week at liberty.</p>

<p>"We seized trunks in their possession on which
were the stamps of the customs officials, showing
that most of the women had come in the second
cabin. In some of these trunks we found sealed
letters, written by girls to parents in France,
begging them to write, and as completing the
slavery chain, we found other letters in possession
of the keepers, written long before by these girls
to parents, which the keepers had received for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
mailing but which they had refused to post for
the helpless prisoners.</p>

<p>"The girls were 18 to 22 years old and had
come through Ellis Island under assumed names.
The letters in the trunks revealed the true names
of the writers. None of them could tell a date
of sailing or date of landing. One of these girls
had $1,500 charged against her for clothing furnished
by the house. Another girl said the house
owed her $890, which she had been unable to collect.
Once a month they were sent to the 'summer
cottage' of this resort, at Blue Island, where
under guard of their slavers, they had the freedom
of an elaborate house and the privileges of
a launch and boats on the river.</p>

<p>"Slavery is the only logical deduction accounting
for these women's presence in these houses.
None of them could tell anything about the appearance
of a steamer ticket. Everything points
to their having been imported to this country by
slave traffickers and of their having been forwarded
to Chicago directly from the port of entry
under charge of some one who assumed all
charge of them to every smallest detail of transportation.
In the Chicago houses raided we
found that some man was held responsible for one
or more of these women. He lived off them and
was looked to to enforce discipline among them
in return for the privilege."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Only the French and the Hungarian resorts
so far have been raided by the United States
district attorney. It is former Assistant State's
Attorney Roe's discovery that on the west side
where ten years ago scarcely a single Jewess was
to be found in a resort, today 80 per cent of the
inmates are Russian and Polish Jews. The field
here is promising to the United States authorities,
who can work only from the statute which
allows of deporting these women under certain
residence restrictions.</p>

<p>One fact accounting for this increase in Jewish
habitues of west side resorts is explained by a
Russian exile in Chicago.</p>

<p>In St. Petersburg, Moscow and other capitals
of Russia only the Jewess in slavery may enter.
It is the only condition under which the Jewish
girl may enter these cities.</p>

<p>At the first necessity for importation, how easy
is the traffic?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Tragedy of the Stage.</span></p>


<p>One thousand innocent girls, the majority of
them still in their teens, are lured to a life of
shame each year in the city of Chicago alone
through the stage.</p>

<p>This is the statement of the police. It is the
statement of the keepers of the dives themselves.</p>

<p>A visit to almost any of the dives of the Twenty-second
street district will convince even the
most skeptical reader of the truth of this statement.</p>

<p>Enter and inquire for a show girl.</p>

<p>True, she will not be the sprightly, supple and
pretty creature one sees nightly on the stages of
the better theaters of the city. Yet she is a
show girl&mdash;or, rather, I might say, has been one.</p>

<p>She is a show girl who has fallen. The sparkle
of wine, the glare of lights and the happy-go-lucky
company of the after-theater parties have
proven her downfall. Under their baneful influences
she has been led on, until now you see her
dull-eyed, disheveled haired, with all ambition
gone, her natural appetites ruined&mdash;a Magdelen.</p>

<p>When a girl becomes a member of a chorus or
ballet of a comic opera company&mdash;that is to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
when she enters the profession&mdash;she is usually a
good girl, of fair education, with supple figure,
and usually beautiful in features. As a rule she
has never kept company with men, moneyed
men, blase men of the world.</p>

<p>In every chorus one will find a number of "old
stagers," or girls who have been in the profession
for several years. They have been through "the
mill." The gay life has attracted them. They
know lots of "dandy good fellows" who are more
than willing to "show them a good time."</p>

<p>The family names of the young men are almost
copyrighted by the newspapers. Every one has
heard of them.</p>

<p>It is easy for the "old stager" to win the young
and inexperienced girl unless the younger show
girl has a great amount of will power. Once
won over, the work is easy.</p>

<p>It starts with a dash through the city in a ten
thousand dollar automobile. Drinks are taken
en route. Of course, the young girl can't refuse.
She is with such nice fellows: The "old stager"
urges her on. The "stager" may have lost her
attractions, but the old gay life must be kept up.
To keep her place in the whirl she must turn procuress
for the rich men who must be amused. If
she did not bring the young girl her company
would not be asked.</p>

<p>The first trip usually proves the first step into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the dark pit. Even though the young show girl
may not have fallen the gay company has had its
effect. The next time a party is suggested there
is no refusal. There is no refusal of the drinks
brought to the girl. The suggestive remarks and
show of animal passion of the male companion
are received with less resentment.</p>

<p>Then the final step towards the brothel is taken.
It may be in the richly furnished apartments
of the young man after a night's carousal.
It may be in some of the loop hotels that live off
of fallen women. It may be in the brothel itself.</p>

<p>The senses may have been dulled by some
sleeping potion. It is not an unusual occurrence
for a girl to be drugged while sipping some innocent
looking drink or partaking of the luxurious
viands set forth at these seemingly gay parties.
The "wealthy young man"&mdash;the companion of
the young girl&mdash;may be a white slaver in disguise,
merely spending the money of his employers, the
keepers of the brothels, that he may be able to
supply them with new human flesh.</p>

<p>The records of the police courts of the city tell
of scores of such cases. They do not tell the
story, however, of the thousands who have been
lured in a like manner and who kept silence because
of their shame.</p>

<p>They do not tell of the young girls to whom
the promise of marriage was made and who, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
this persuasion, fell. In some instances the
promise is even fulfilled, but the girl wife awakes
to find herself even farther advanced toward the
ultimate goal&mdash;the brothel.</p>

<p>Once on the downward path, there is but little
chance of reformation. The thought of her shame
drives her from her purer companions. She seeks
company that is on a lower moral plane. The
dull, innocent existence and the purer pleasures
no longer attract her. Home and parents are
forgotten in the mad whirl. Religion and home
teachings are a thing of the past. The whole nature
has changed.</p>

<p>She gradually assumes the habits and customs
of her immoral companions. She drops into the
slangy language of the underworld. The oaths
and drunkenness that once were repellant to her
are heard with an unmoved conscience. Her
physical charms are attacked by this fly-by-night
existence. All of the innocent attributes that
once were applauded and extolled are dead.</p>

<p>The managers no longer want her. She is not
sprightly enough. Her voice has lost its charm
and her face is dull. They must have girls who
excite interest and enliven their audiences. It is
only a short time until she is unable to find a place
to work.</p>

<p>It is a mad, wild dash while it lasts&mdash;good cheer
and Bohemian fellowship, but it always has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
ultimate end&mdash;the furnished flat or the recognized
den of vice.</p>

<p>It may last a year, it may last several, but the
goal is the same. The girl who "saw the good
time and met such nice fellows" is eventually a
victim to the caprice of flesh buyers. In the end
she doles out her own body for a price. This is
the price she pays for her "good time."</p>

<p>But few of the girls who start on this downward
path ever reform. Many have tried, but
the way is too hard. They meet persons who
have known them when they were leading this
evil existence. They are slighted and scoffed at.
Their ambition to again become pure and good is
thwarted. As a rule they sink back into the
whirl. This time they give up in utter abandon.
Nothing is then too bad or repulsive. The end is
not far off.</p>

<p>The girl in the road company is subjected to
the greater temptations. She must travel at all
hours of the night and day. The road shows
usually play but one night in a town.</p>

<p>The hotel accommodations are usually poor.
In some places she must "double up" with somebody.
Sometimes it is a male companion.</p>

<p>In the burlesque shows this is not regarded as
out of the way. The chorus girls of these vulgar
attractions are usually "castoffs" or "has beens"
from the comic operas or more wholesome attractions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Their charms have diminished, therefore
they must accept these more lowly positions.</p>

<p>The dressing rooms of men in many of the
smaller theaters are in close connection of those
of the women. Recently in the city of Chicago
a crusade was started against these places. Some
alterations were made, but the condition in many
instances is unimproved.</p>

<p>The young girls are taught and drilled that
sex is to be forgotten on the stage.</p>

<p>Here feminine traits are to be left at home. If
a girl is asked to kiss or throw her arms about a
man, no matter what character he may be, it is
her duty to do so. If she is asked to bare her
body to the public gaze, with nothing but skin
tights to cover her nudity, it is her duty to do so.
That is what she is being paid for.</p>

<p>The animal nature of the audience must be
satisfied.</p>

<p>Every year the vulgarity becomes more and
more apparent. New and more suggestive novelties
must be introduced to satisfy this "taste."
The songs must have a "meaning"&mdash;the dances,
some of which bring the blush of shame to the
brow of even the most hardened theater-goers&mdash;must
also arouse the passion.</p>

<p>The good girl first rebels at such. Day in
and day out, as she rehearses, she sees other girls
doing the thing that is required without kick or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
objection. She gradually falls into it herself. It
does not look so bad after she has bowed to the
manager's wishes several times.</p>

<p>It isn't long before the things that once caused
her to blush and falter seem to be a natural consequence.
The things against which she once
fought are repulsive no longer.</p>

<p>She gradually falls into line with the others.
Her innocence is a thing of the past.</p>

<p>She is no longer a girl&mdash;she is a woman "who
knows."</p>

<p>It was about a year ago that I saw a young
girl, a beautiful little creature scarcely nineteen
years old, at a Chicago theater. She was a beauty,
even in comparison with the other comely
girls in the squad of beginners.</p>

<p>While they were resting after an act I talked
with her. She frankly told me she was stage
struck, but that her desire to become a great
actress was inborn and not gained by association.
Before she came to the city from her home in a
little town out in Iowa she had seen but one show.
Her ideas of the stage had been gained from
books and from day dreams.</p>

<p>Her conversation was the essence of innocence.
Her family had been particular about her rearing.
They had been in moderate circumstances
and had given her everything in their power. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
had come to Chicago to attain her ideal&mdash;to become
a great actress.</p>

<p>She was of the frank and innocent type. Everybody
she regarded as her friend. She was enthusiastic
about her art. That her ambition
would be realized she did not doubt for an instant.</p>

<p>It was ten months later when I met her again.</p>

<p>Her face wore a tell-tale look. The daintiness
of bearing and innocent features were missing.
Her shyness was gone. She was bold, and immeasureably
aged.</p>

<p>A heavy coat of powder and rouge besmeared
her face, but only served to make the dark circles
beneath her eyes stand forth with more prominence.
The simple, childish gown I had admired
was replaced by a showy, flashy creation.</p>

<p>In one glance I read the answer, the secret of
her changed existence.</p>

<p>When her eyes met mine, for a second in their
dull depths I could see an expression of the old
innocence. Probably it was the thought she entertained
for that short space in the connecting
of me with her old and pure existence.</p>

<p>When she spoke I could not be mistaken. Try
as she did to appear the girl of old, it was useless.
The pace had told and left its trace only too
strongly written on every line of her face.</p>

<p>After the usual greeting I asked her to take
dinner with me. She assented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>In the cafe I asked her what had happened.
How she had fallen.</p>

<p>For a minute she sat gazing at me and her eyes
filled with tears.</p>

<p>"Do I look that way? Can every one I meet
read what I am?" she asked tearfully.</p>

<p>I tried to evade her questioning, but she
pressed for an answer. Then I told her that I
was afraid her secret was only too plainly written.</p>

<p>"Why don't you give it up and go home?" I
asked her.</p>

<p>She thought a minute and then answered that
she couldn't.</p>

<p>"I'm not as bad as lots of the others," she said
desperately. "I don't hope and long any more
to become a great actress.</p>

<p>"I found there were so many more girls who
were more accomplished than me. I couldn't
get anything but a chorus part. I became discouraged
and went out for good times. I had
them, I guess."</p>

<p>When I asked her to go home and try to begin
over again her anger was aroused. The company
she had kept had left its mark on her.</p>

<p>"Say, now, don't hand me any of that religious
talk," was her angry answer. "It's nothing to
you why I don't go home. I've had good times
and I am going to have more of them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>I talked to her for a few minutes, but soon
found argument to be useless. We ate our dinner
quietly and without further words. When I
parted with her it seemed as though it were for
the last time. I knew the end that was near at
hand&mdash;the specter that was waiting for her.</p>

<p>It was three weeks later when I saw her again.
There was a different setting for the scene than
at our two other meetings.</p>

<p>The scene was laid in a cell room at the Harrison
street police station. On an iron cot lay a
young girl. She was in a maudlin condition from
drugs. Her clothes were dirty and torn. Her
face was discolored and bloated.</p>

<p>It was the same girl&mdash;the little innocent show
girl of a year before.</p>

<p>She had been arrested in a raid by the police
on the notorious Clark street opium dive of On
Ling Lung. Lying in a dirty cot in the rear of
the basement den, she had been found by the raiders.
She was unconscious. On a little stand by
her side had been a little alcohol lamp. On the
bunk beside her lay an opium pipe.</p>

<p>I asked the sergeant the details of her arrest.</p>

<p>"The station stool pigeons who had been watching
the place saw her go down into it about a
week ago," said the sergeant. "A well dressed
Chinaman was with her. She looked as though
she was drunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"We wanted to get all of those opium smokers
down there all at once, so we waited a week. I
don't think she has eaten much since she went
there. Just laid there and smoked.</p>

<p>"After they get a taste of the dreamy stuff
they can't leave it alone. It's poison and it just
goes all through them.</p>

<p>"You don't want to monkey with her," the sergeant
admonished when I suggested that I would
see that care would be given her. "She's gone
now. She got the taste, and there's no use trying
to break it. You couldn't. She'll get a
couple of months down in the Bridewell and it'll
straighten her up for a while, but she'll be back
in a little while.</p>

<p>"No, sir, there's no use talking, when they once
get a whiff of that dope they might as well jump
in the lake. They're no good."</p>

<p>She was still lying in a stupor on the iron cot
when I left the dingy cell room. In a couple of
hours she would awaken, but only to go into a
delirium.</p>

<p>As I left I could see a vision of the innocent
girl of the year before, standing among the
sceneries of the down-town theater, telling of her
ambitions.</p>

<p>How far had her whole being retrograded from
that day!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>But she was only one of many&mdash;a victim of the
stage.</p>

<p>Probably the greatest agency through which
girls are lured is the fake "theatrical agency."</p>

<p>In Chicago there exists many of these clearing
houses for the vice trust. Sumptuous offices are
maintained in great office buildings down town.
Large office forces are necessary to carry on the
enormous business they conduct.</p>

<p>These concerns operate usually under a name
similar to those of the legitimate and responsible
theatrical agencies. Their advertisements usually
appear in papers in small towns and cities.
The police keep a close watch on them, but without
result.</p>

<p>Few of the girls obtained by the slavers
through these agencies are ruined in the city.</p>

<p>The "theatrical agency" slaver works in this
manner:</p>

<p>He advertises in papers all over the country
for girls "who wish to take up theatrical work."
Even in the city papers he inserts ads disguised,
but with the same meaning.</p>

<p>Large salaries are offered to beginners.
Chances of advancement within a few months to
parts in plays are held out. Offers are made to
sign contracts for several years' duration.</p>

<p>Every girl must answer the advertisement in
person. This is imperative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Scores of girls do answer the ads. They usually
range from 16 to 21 years in age. The majority
of them come from families in only moderate
circumstances.</p>

<p>They are received with every courtesy. If the
girl is good looking, of good figure and a fair entertainer
she is "accepted" by the fashionably
dressed manager. If she is not up to these requirements
she is told to come back.</p>

<p>When the girl signs the "contract" her fate is
sealed. Great inducements are offered her.</p>

<p>She is told that she must join a road company
traveling in the west, and which will perform in
a city probably 100 or 150 miles away on a near
date.</p>

<p>The girl, happy at her good fortune, is enthusiastic.
She bids her family a fond good-bye,
the last, probably.</p>

<p>The kiss she places fondly on her mother's
brow is that of a person going to her grave. The
laughing farewells she has with her young friends
are the last. The homecoming within a few
months' time is never to be realized.</p>

<p>The signing of her name to the contract is
the signing of her death warrant&mdash;yes, even
worse than that.</p>

<p>In that stroke of the pen she signs away her
body to the slavers.</p>

<p>Happily, probably accompanied by a relative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
she goes to the "theatrical agency" office to obtain
her railroad ticket. There she is introduced
to a stylishly dressed man. He is to accompany
her and several other girls down to the city where
they are to join the troupe, she is told.</p>

<p>The stylishly dressed man is, in reality, her
guard. It is his duty to see that none of the
girls escape their fate. He is to hand them over
to the divekeepers for a sum ranging from $50 to
$1,000 each, at the end of their journey.</p>

<p>Until the girls are handed over to the denkeepers
they are treated with the utmost respect.</p>

<p>They go to their fate like innocent sheep to the
slaughter pen.</p>

<p>Probably they are taken to the city where they
were told they were going. Probably there is a
"sudden change of plans" after the girls are at
the depot. They are then taken to another city
from the destination told their relatives and
friends.</p>

<p>On the arrival at the end of their journey they
are met by a woman. She is stylishly dressed and
wears many beautiful diamonds. She is probably
introduced as the "leading lady." She has taken
a special interest in the new girls. She offers to
show them about the city.</p>

<p>It is probably at dinner or while they sleep
innocently that night, dreaming of their good
fortune, that they are robbed of their senses. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
handkerchief, wet with chloroform or ether,
spread over their faces does the work. Or it
may be a small powder dropped in their coffee.</p>

<p>Then comes the awful awakening.</p>

<p>The scene changes to a den of vice. The young
girls awake in a darkened room. Each one is
alone. All of her clothes have been taken from
her. She is nude. Her head seems to be bursting.
It is the after-effect of the drug.</p>

<p>As she begins to regain her faculties more fully
she makes out the figure of a man in her room.
As he sees her beginning to revive he comes towards
her. She attempts to cover up her nude
body. She struggles to free herself as he grabs
hold of her. He laughs at her pitiable efforts to
repulse him.</p>

<p>What matter it if she does resist him! She has
been ruined while she lay unconscious under the
influence of the drug!</p>

<p>The young girl, terrified and ill, is easily made
a friend of by the woman who comes to her and
offers her sympathy. She drinks of the "medicine"
that is offered her. In a few minutes she
is in a maudlin condition.</p>

<p>It is more "dope."</p>

<p>Under the influence of this drug she is a mark
at the hands of the denkeepers. She is given
whisky and liquor. As the effects of the drug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
die out she craves for more. Liquor is given in
its stead.</p>

<p>For several weeks she may be kept in this state.
She is maudlin and resents no liberties taken with
her.</p>

<p>Then comes the awakening. When the divekeeper
thinks she is sufficiently "broke in" she is
refused liquor. She gradually becomes sober.</p>

<p>It is an awful awakening. The darkness of it
all&mdash;the thought of her ruin drives her mad.
She is watched carefully for days so that she can
not harm herself. To forget the terrible things
she is forced to do, she goes back to drink. Under
its influence she is past knowing of her forced
sins.</p>

<p>Her every hope is ruined. If she attempted to
leave the place she would be beaten and imprisoned.
The young girl is ashamed, anyway, to
go home and confess the story of her "theatrical"
career.</p>

<p>She stays behind and becomes one of them. In
the little home, probably only a hundred miles
away, a father and mother wait expectantly for
her homecoming.</p>

<p>The wait is long, for she never returns. She
has been swallowed up by the giant octopus,
white slavery.</p>

<p>An example of this method of white slavery
was recently exposed in the Chicago newspapers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Two young girls, one 15 years old, the other
16, applied for positions at one of these "theatrical
agencies." They were given positions in a
"show" that was playing at Springfield, Illinois.</p>

<p>A big salary was guaranteed both of them.
They were happy at their good luck. Both ran
away from home to accept the positions. A man
accompanied them to Springfield.</p>

<p>In a restaurant in the capital city of Illinois
they were drugged. Poison was placed in their
food. When they woke up they were in one of
the lowest dives of the city, the "Big O" saloon
and brothel.</p>

<p>In this place are kept fifty girls. The majority
of them were obtained by a similar method.
There is only one entrance to the floor on which
the girls were confined. That door was to a stairway
that connected the upper floor with the saloon.
A man stood on guard to see that none
of the girls escaped.</p>

<p>Three times the girls attempted to escape. In
the last effort one of them was successful. The
other two times the girls were beaten and starved
when caught.</p>

<p>The girl who escaped made her way to a police
station. She was garbed only in a short wrapper
that reached barely to her knees. The remainder
of her person was bare. Her clothes had been
taken from her when she was taken to the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The police at once raided the place and rescued
the other girl. The Chicago police were notified
and returned both of them to their parents.</p>

<p>Both girls had been horribly treated. Every
liberty that can be imagined had been taken with
them. They had been forced to do acts beyond
comprehension.</p>

<p>This is but one actual instance of the methods
employed to lure girls to an awful fate, but it
tells the story of hundreds.</p>

<p>This is but one method whereby the great slave
mart of Chicago is kept in operation, sacrificing
its thousands of girl to the demon lust.</p>

<p>The stage, with all its attractions, can be but
the stepping stone to a life of shame, unless the
girl is surrounded with every home protection.</p>

<p>It leads its victims a merry whirl, a gay, giddy

<p>The brothel flirts with the stage. It regards
it as a needful source of supplies.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Tragedy of the Five Thousand.</span></p>


<p>It was the cold gray dawn of a late November
morning. The scene is laid in the marshy slough
far to the north of the buildings of the Dunning
poor farm at the north edge of the city of Chicago.</p>

<p>In the chill and drizzling rain an aged, bent-shouldered
man was digging. The soft, wet mud
he tossed in a pile alongside of the hole in which
he stood. Finally he slowly clambered out of
the pit and surveyed his work.</p>

<p>The hole was nearly six feet long and three
feet wide. It was about the latter in depth.</p>

<p>Suddenly the old man looked up. To the
south of him he heard the rumble of a wagon. A
few minutes later the rusty gate at the end of the
meadow swung creakingly on its hinges. With
a rattle and bounce the wagon again started towards
him.</p>

<p>The wagon was a high boarded affair. On
its side could be read the inscription, "City of
Chicago," and then the number "321."</p>

<p>The vehicle drew up close to the hole. The
driver reined in his galloping horses with a jerk
at its side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, Bill. Been waiting long?" yelled the
driver to the old man as he jumped from his seat.</p>

<p>"Just finished," answered the digger.</p>

<p>The driver by this time was busy with the end-gate
of his wagon. Letting it down, he pulled
at a long box in the vehicle.</p>

<p>The box was a hastily constructed affair. It
was of plain, unfinished boards. Sticking to the
boards were pieces of colored lithographs, as
though they had once been part of a dismantled
billboard. The top consisted of two heavy planks
roughly nailed on.</p>

<p>The driver struggled with the box a moment.
Then he came around to where the aged man
stood.</p>

<p>"You've got to help me, Bill. She's a darn
heavy one," exclaimed the driver.</p>

<p>The two men clambered up on the wagon and
grabbed hold of one end of the box. Together
they lifted it in the air. The box slid to the
ground, on end, with a thud.</p>

<p>The men took hold of the box and skidded it
along the muddy ground to the pit. It was slid
off to the top of the hole. There it stuck.</p>

<p>"Gee, Bill, you didn't get that hole long
enough," exclaimed the driver.</p>

<p>"You guys up at the dead house didn't tell me
she was a six footer," muttered the old man.
"How'd you expect me to guess on these stiffs?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind, Bill, I'll fix it," said the driver.</p>

<p>Then, suiting his words, he leaped high into
the air and came down with a bound on one end
of the box. The soft ground gave away after a
few attempts and the big box sank with a sucking
sound in the bottom of the hole.</p>

<p>"Take care of her good, Bill," yelled back the
driver, as he clambered back on the seat of his
wagon. "She's a swell one. She came from the
E&mdash;&mdash; club. She certainly was a peach.</p>

<p>"Doc told me, when I was loading her on a
while ago, that it was a dirty shame to waste
such a good stiff. He said that if she hadn't
been so far gone they'd have handed her over to
the medical schools."</p>

<p>Then, with a rumble, the wagon started off on
its return journey.</p>

<p>The old man gazed down for a moment on the
box. On its top, inscribed with black paint, was
the number "24331."</p>

<p>At the side of the pile of dirt lay a little six
inch board, which the driver had thrown from the
wagon. It, too, bore the number "24331."</p>

<p>The old man dug his spade into the wet dirt.
Then he pitched a huge clod into the pit. It
struck with a resounding bang on the lid of the
box. In a few minutes the hole was filled. The
old man stuck the numbered stick into the ground
at the head of the mound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Stretching away in long rows on either side,
hundreds of other similar numbered sticks jutted
from unkempt mounds.</p>

<p>The old digger shouldered his spade and started
slowly to leave the scene. Then he stopped
and slowly surveyed his work.</p>

<p>"A swell one, huh," he half muttered to himself.
"Well, so was lots of the rest of them that's
out here now&mdash;once."</p>

<p>Then, with a sigh, he started on his long trudge
across the muddy meadow towards the buildings
of the poorhouse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the night of the same day.</p>

<p>The myriad of incandescents in the "red light"
district lighted that section of the city as though
it were day. Drunken crowds of fashionably
dressed men caroused about the streets, hurling
vile names at persons they met. Down at the
edge of the district a fight was waging. A large
crowd had collected. A blue-coated policeman
dashed towards the combatants, club in hand.
There was a wild scramble in all directions.</p>

<p>In the shadows of a big building a man was
crouching. His cap was pulled low about his
eyes to shield him from recognition.</p>

<p>He was a "roller," or holdup man. He was
watching a particularly drunken man who staggered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
along the street. If the man went into
the darkness his fate would be sealed. The
"roller" would be upon him like a panther. A
crunching blow on the head with the short lead
bar that the robber gripped in his hand. Then a
hurried searching of the man's pockets. The
extracting of his money and watch. Then back
into the darkness again to wait for a new victim.</p>

<p>Suddenly the man drew back further into his
hiding place. An automobile had stopped directly
opposite him, in front of the E&mdash;&mdash; club.
A well dressed man leaped from the machine and
gave orders to his chauffeur to wait until he returned.</p>

<p>The man hurried up the steps to the massive
door. The bell pealed back in an inner parlor.
A liveried servant opened the door. As the man
entered a negress, an assistant keeper, came towards
him.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, where have you been
for the last couple of weeks?" inquired the
woman.</p>

<p>"Been out of town," answered the man. Then
he glanced around the place.</p>

<p>"Where's Mabel?" he asked, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"She's not here any more," muttered the negress.</p>

<p>"What's the matter&mdash;sick, is she?" asked the
visitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nope; worse. She croaked a couple of days
ago," answered the woman.</p>

<p>"Too bad," answered the man. "She was a
pretty girl. Well, that's the end of her, I guess.
Got any new ones?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we got one in today to take her place,"
answered the woman. And then she added, with
a laugh: "She thinks she's in a swell place and
is going to have a big time. She's a beauty,
though; eighteen years old and raised in a little
town down state."</p>

<p>"All right, run her out and let me see her,"
broke in the man.</p>

<p>In the big den of vice there was no mourning.
The mentioning of the dead girl's name was forbidden.
The thought of death might act as a
damper on the night's orgy. A day later she
would not be missed. Another girl would take
her place. Perchance some one might drop in
some day and ask for her, but only in a matter-of-course
way.</p>

<p>Only one girl in 80,000 dead. What did she
count in that vast host?</p>

<p>One day, but a few weeks ago, I entered one
of these dens on Armour avenue, in Chicago.
I wandered up on to the second floor without
the knowledge of the keepers. An open door attracted
my attention. Peering in I saw a young
girl lying on a bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Her head and face were swathed in bandages.</p>

<p>She seemed to be in great pain. On a table
near at hand were several bottles of medicine.
She was without a nurse and alone in the room.</p>

<p>I asked her what was the matter, but she only
shook her head and refused to answer. I persisted.
After much persuasion she lifted an edge
of the bandage and exposed her face.</p>

<p>It was a mass of burns.</p>

<p>Before I could inquire further a negress keeper
entered the room.</p>

<p>"You can't stay in here," she said angrily.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the girl?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, she got foolish the other day and took
a dose of carbolic acid," was the answer. "She
ain't burned bad&mdash;at least not as bad as I've seen
lots of them. Don't give her any of that soft
home talk and she'll get over it all right in a couple
of days."</p>

<p>With this the woman held the door open and
motioned for me to leave.</p>

<p>In the early morning, three days later, I happened
to pass the same place. A wagon, painted
black and without a name to designate its owner,
was standing in the road at a side entrance.</p>

<p>I stood watching for a few minutes. Presently
the door opened. Four men came out carrying
between them an undertaker's stretcher. On it
lay a body covered with a white sheet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>I approached and asked one who was
dead.</p>

<p>"Just one of the girls here," was the answer.
Then he added: "Say, but she's an awful sight;
she took carbolic."</p>

<p>He pulled back the sheet. It was the girl whom
the negress had said "got foolish."</p>

<p>"Where are you taking her?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, she goes over to the county morgue. She
ain't got any money and the house didn't want
to pay for her burial. No one knows where her
folks live and I don't expect they'd want her anyhow
if they found out what she was doing up
here. The students will get her, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Hurry her up, Joe," broke in another one of
the men at this juncture; "let us get away from
here. The boss inside'll be sore if we stick
around. He ain't anxious to advertise the fact
that he'd had a dead one in his house."</p>

<p>The men jumped on the wagon. The horses
started on a trot with their burden towards the
county morgue.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In one den is a girl who has saved $5,000 from
the money she derived from the sale of her body.
She is in a class by herself in this respect, for but
a few of them save a cent.</p>

<p>This girl was, a few years ago, a stenographer.
She was ruined by her employer and finally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
when he had tired of her, discharged from her
position. She had saved nothing. Penniless and
without friends, she heeded the advice of an evil
companion and entered a house of prostitution.</p>

<p>Every cent she could eke and scrape she has
saved since she entered this den. Her hope was
that she might be able to save enough so that
she could go to the far west and live down her
past life. But the grasp of the devil held her to
her bargain. When the time came she found
that she could not break off her unnatural habits.
She could not be innocent and good again.
So she stayed behind.</p>

<p>"How long do you think you will be able to
keep up this life?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"Oh, four or five years, I guess," she answered
between puffs of a cigarette she was smoking.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do then?"</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking about that time," she said.</p>

<p>"When I get worn out and they tell me they
don't want me here any more, I'll go somewhere&mdash;I'm
not worrying where.</p>

<p>"I'd quit now, but what's the use? If I left
here every one would be kicking me down in the
gutter. Now suppose I wanted to be good, would
mothers you know want their nice, innocent
daughters associating with me? No, you know
they wouldn't. It would be only a couple of
weeks and then I'd be back again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have any of the girls in this place saved
money except you?" was asked.</p>

<p>"There isn't a girl in the place who has ten dollars
to her name except me," was the answer.</p>

<p>"How long have the majority of them been
leading this life?"</p>

<p>"Most of them about two or three years. You
see, this is a 'dollar house.' We don't get many
of the young ones in here," was the reply.</p>

<p>"How are you paid in this place?" was asked.</p>

<p>"The girls get half of what they get from men.
Then they get a tin check for two and a half
cents for every bottle of beer they drink with the
fellows that come in. They have to accept every
drink offered them.</p>

<p>"They are charged five dollars a week for their
board here by the keeper of the place. They have
to buy all their clothes through him, too. They
are charged big prices, so they don't have a
chance to save."</p>

<p>"What does the average girl make in this
place?" was asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, $12 to $18 a week, I guess. They have
to pay their board and for their clothes out of
that," replied the girl.</p>

<p>In the "red light" district of Chicago is an
organized "trust." At its head are five big politicians.
They practically control the district.</p>

<p>The trust owns a dry goods store, a grocery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
store, a delicatessen, a drug store, a restaurant
and a hotel. It has its own manicure parlors, its
own dentist parlor and its own doctors. Every
necessity of the denizens of the vice ridden district
is catered to by this company.</p>

<p>The girls of the district must patronize them.
This is an iron-bound order that cannot be
broken.</p>

<p>Suppose that a girl in one of the dens wishes
to purchase a dress. She goes to the dry goods
store. There she makes her choice.</p>

<p>Before she leaves the house in which she is an
inmate, the person in charge there gives her a
slip of paper. It certifies that she is an inmate of
that house.</p>

<p>She hands this to the shop keeper. After she
has made her purchase she is handed back another
slip. On it is marked the price of the
dress. It is always double or triple the amount
for which she could have purchased the same article
at any other store.</p>

<p>When she returns to the house she turns this
slip in. At the end of the week, when the house
gives her the money she has earned, that exorbitant
charge is deducted from the amount.</p>

<p>This conveys but a small idea of the bondage
system that holds the girls of the district in its
grasp. The exorbitant prices charged the girls
for commodities keeps them constantly indebted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to the keeper of the den where they are inmates.
They never get ahead.</p>

<p>If a girl attempted to leave the house without
satisfying this debt her clothes would be taken
from her. If she ran away she would probably
be arrested, charged with theft or some other
crime. Perjured testimony would be introduced
against her. Her word would count for little.
In court she would be regarded as a fallen woman.
What she might say would be scorned. A
jail sentence would be the result.</p>

<p>This is one of the many reasons why few girls
leave these dens after they have once become inmates.</p>

<p>The white slaver, who hands young innocent
girls over to this ghastly, reeking life, is not a
type. He may be a prize fighter, an army officer,
son of a preacher or a banker.</p>

<p>A year ago Chicago was startled when in a
round-up of these local drivers of white slaves,
the young man Leonard, son of a banker, skilled
bank clerk and idol of his mother, was fined $200
and costs for his crime.</p>

<p>It was a former officer in the Hungarian army
who but a short time ago in Chicago showed this
hold that white slavery has upon the slaver. In
this case the man Sterk received a sentence of
one year in prison. Sterk was a man of family.
He placed Tereza Jenney in a resort in Budapest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
and was living upon her shame. The girl
escaped after a year and came to Chicago. Sterk,
deserting his family, followed by the next boat.
His income was gone. To get the woman back
was his necessity.</p>

<p>But Sterk made a faux pas. He appealed to
the government to deport his victim and made
arrangements to return with her on the same
boat. When under faulty indictment Sterk escaped
the United States court, he was caught
on a state charge and convicted.</p>

<p>In many cases, however, the court has had no
chance to intervene. The girls go on and on in
their lives of shame. Disease overtakes them in
the end. Weakened physically by their excesses,
they are unable to cope with it. Liquor
and cigarettes leave tell-tale ravages.</p>

<p>Hopelessly battling against grim disease, the
victim goes deeper and deeper into the last depths
of repulsiveness. Her only hope of forgetting
her affliction is in drunkenness. She loses all her
womanly instincts and is a fiend. Finally liquor
fails to keep her in that state of stupor in which
she must remain. Cocaine and morphine are resorted
to.</p>

<p>One day she regains consciousness. The darkness
of her horrible existence enshrouds her. Remorse
and recollections of her past engulf her.
She realizes the futileness of her life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Then comes the end.</p>

<p>Maybe it is by the aid of a bottle of chloroform;
maybe a gas jet is turned on; maybe there
is the lifeless body of an "unknown" woman taken
from the waters of Lake Michigan the next
morning.</p>

<p>There are no tears wasted. A shrug of the
shoulders on the part of the owner of the resort&mdash;probably
he swears a bit when her name is
mentioned. He hates to have such things happen
to girls in his place, because "people might
think that he is hard with people."</p>

<p>The murderer goes to the gallows with the
priest and minister at his side. He is given his
chance of repentance. He is given religious consolation.</p>

<p>To the fallen woman&mdash;once pure and innocent&mdash;dragged
to her shame through her innocence&mdash;is
held out no comfort. She is not given the opportunity
to repent. She is a thing, repellant
and abhorred. The very mention of her name
brings a derisive laugh. No masses are said for
the repose of her soul. Religious consolation is
not to be thought of.</p>

<p>Her obituary is the notice, hidden among the
advertisements of the local newspapers.</p>

<p>Notice: The body of Mabel Gormly, who died
on November 15, 1909, is being held at the county<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
morgue. If the same is not claimed by relatives
within five days it will be disposed of according
to law.</p>

<p>Disposed of according to law means that it will
be turned over to the medical schools for dissection,
or if the body is not fit for such, will be carted
to the pauper's graveyard at the poor farm.</p>

<p>With a few changes in minor detail this tells
the story of the five thousand.</p>

<p>It tells of the end of the 5,000 innocents who
yearly are lured to a life of shame in the city of
Chicago alone.</p>

<p>It tells the story of the vacant chair at the
hearthside of many a home throughout the country.</p>

<p>It is the annual tragedy, repeated not once,
but 5,000 times yearly, in Chicago.</p>

<p>The end is the dissecting table&mdash;the potter's
field&mdash;the lake.</p>

<p>As a prelude to the story which Ella Gingles
tells for herself from the beginning of her trip
from Ireland to America and her horrible experiences,
the following letter which was received
by Attorney Patrick H. O'Donnell from her
pastor, is printed.</p>

<p class="right">
Larne Manse, Larne, Co. Antrim, Ireland.<br />
<span style="margin-right: 1.5em">29th June, 1909.</span><br />
</p><p>
Dear Sir:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>Last evening two American ladies, Miss Hopkins,
of Chicago, and Mrs. Murphy, of Minneapolis,
called upon me with reference to the poor
young girl, Ella Gingles, whom, like a chivalrous-hearted
Irishman, you have done and are
doing so much to protect and defend. I know
her well, her father is a member of the Congregation
of which I am minister, as were his ancestors
before him. He is a large farmer, well
off, as Irish farmers go here in the North of Ireland,
and his wife, Ella's mother, is an exceedingly
nice, gentle-hearted woman. They have had
a large family&mdash;thirteen, if my memory serves
me&mdash;and as their minister I christened them all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and have seen them grow up from infancy. Ella
was frequently under my roof, as she was on
friendly terms with two young ladies&mdash;my adopted
daughters&mdash;who reside with me. I always
found her a bright, cheerful, well-principled girl,
clever in many ways with her needle, etc., and
especially in the art of crocheting and manufacturing
lace. In the latter branches I know that
she won prizes at our local annual industrial exhibitions
in the town of Larne. But the family
being large and their not being particularly prosperous
here in Ireland, she and other young
members of the family, like many other young
people of energy and enterprise, have sought a
land of better promise across the Atlantic with
sad results to her unfortunately. As I have said,
she is the child of respectable and well-off parents.
She, herself so far as I know, has always
been respectable and well conducted in every
way, with a large infusion of enterprise and determination
in her character; so that you may
proceed in your generous and energetic endeavors
in her behalf with the most entire confidence
in her integrity in every respect. Accept
for yourself and convey to those truly Christian
people who are associated with you in the defense
of an innocent, but much-injured young girl, the
assurance of the most sincere gratitude and admiration,
not only of the writer, but of the sorely-stricken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
parents and friends of poor Ella, and
believe me,</p>

<p class="center">
Sincerely yours,<br />
<br />
J. Kennedy,<br />
<br />
Minister of the Old Presbyterian Congregation<br />
of Larne &amp; Kilwaughter.<br />
<br />
(Postmarked): "Larne, Ireland, June 30, 1909."<br />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Ella Gingles.</span></p>

<p>It is a long and hard way when one must set
forth to expose one's own butchery, shame and
misfortune, but I feel that in telling this story
the very fact that I have been a victim will carry
with it weight.</p>

<p>It is a far cry from the green hills of Larne,
from the wet meadows, glistening with the rains,
from the song of the nightingale in the gathering
dusk, the sweetness, the beauty of that green island
which I call my home and which will henceforth
be my only home, to the mire and filth of a
criminal court in the city of Chicago, to the unspeakable
horrors through which I have been
dragged, and to the desperation to which I was
driven.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a very far cry, from sweetness and
light to mire and filth, but I feel that in justice
to myself I must tell this thing as it is. I do not
feel now as if this mire and filth had touched my
person. I feel today that although I have been
the victim of human fiends, although I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
more monstrously abused than any other girl of
my age or character in the world, I myself am as
clean and pure as on the day when I left that
little Irish homestead 18 miles from Belfast and
came to America. One who is murdered is not a
murderer, nor is one who is outraged a person of
bad character. And a clean mind soon forgets
even the most terrible episodes, the most awful
happenings. Yes, I will forget everything that
has happened and become again the girl who left
Ireland such a short time ago to become a victim
of fiends.</p>

<p>There are things that one must try to forget,
although I know in my heart that my sleep till
my dying day will be haunted by the pictures of
the demons who have worked their will upon me
and who if they had their just deserts should burn
in deepest hades forever. But I will forget, I
must forget. If I do not forget I shall go mad.</p>

<p>They say that I have been cool, calm and collected
on the witness stand during my trial. I
have been cool, calm and collected because I was
telling the truth, but the reaction from those
awful hours in court have been so terrible that I
shudder even yet to think of them.</p>

<p>It was only the thought of the green hills, of
the heather, of the blossoms in Spring and the
yellow corn at harvest time, of the cuddling
mother love, of the kindly faces which will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
turn away because I have been tortured&mdash;just
the green hills, the green hills, and the rains and
the sunshine and the light and the purity&mdash;I can
say no more, but they will help me to forget,
they will help me to become again the girl who
won the lace prizes in Larne and the girl who
had not been the victim of fiends. I will forget
there. I could never forget here. America has
become to me a nightmare, a horror; the name
stands to me for all that is vile, horrible, unmentionable.</p>

<p>I am telling my story, not because I have any
animus against anybody, not because I wish to
get even with anybody, not because I wish to
clear my own name, because I believe that has
been cleared before the world by the solemn edict
of a jury&mdash;not because I wish to create or to have
brought forth the terrible things which were done
to me.</p>

<p>I am telling this story in the hope of saving
other girls, who like myself may be in danger
from the beastly "slavers" and a life of shame.
If I can but save a few girls from this horrible
fate, if I can only help, in some modest way, to
protect womanhood from the horrors of white
slavery, I shall feel happy for laying bare my
soul and giving to the world the true story of the
attempt to make a white slave out of me.</p>

<p>I feel that I must write it, that American girls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and girls of foreign birth who come to America,
will not be misled and trapped as I was into the
veritable jaws of hell. If I can keep a single
girl out of this hell on earth by telling the plain
story of what happened to me, I shall feel that I
have done my duty by myself.</p>

<p>I am told by men who know about these awful
things that my case is only one of many. What
happened to me may be an isolated instance and
I am told that it is representative of the workings
of the panders for the "upper ring," or the
dealing in girls' bodies by rich men, rather than
the selling of girls to cheap resorts through a
quicker route.</p>

<p>I feel that there is no pit too deep for people
who will send an innocent girl into a life of
shame, who will throw temptation in a girl's way,
and will, when temptation fails, resort to force to
drive her into hades itself.</p>

<p>I was born in Larne, Ireland. My parents are
respectable middle class people and property
owners. Our family is a large one, there being
thirteen children. We are protestants, as are
most of the people of that particular district of
Ireland, our church being the Presbyterian. We
have always been members of that church, as the
letter from our pastor shows.</p>

<p>Larne, the city where I was reared, is a little
town about 18 miles from Belfast. One of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
principal industries of the town is the making
of hand-made Irish laces. I was brought up to
the lace-making trade. I won several prizes
against the best lace-makers in the Belfast region.
I have invented one particular lace pattern
of my own, an improved "grape-vine pattern."
With this I won the lace-making prize
in Larne on the occasion.</p>

<p>In Ireland there are continual tales of America,
how easy it is to make money over there. I
had never been farther away from Larne than
Belfast in all my life. Many Irish girls had come
to America, worked for a time and returned home
with money, placing herself in a position to help
out her parents in their old age. These stories
attracted me. I met girls who had been to America.
They had made lots of money and had fine
clothes. The name America soon came to mean
to me a golden land in the West, as it has meant
to many another simple Irish girl. The spell
came upon me so strongly that I could think of
nothing else. I could see nothing but a golden
land, and a fortune that I could make there with
my laces, for I had heard that fabulous prices
were paid for Irish laces in America. I begged
my people to let me go to America. After much
pleading they gave their consent.</p>

<p>I was about to purchase my ticket in Belfast
when word reached me that Belle Raymond, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
girl I knew in Belfast and who had already purchased
her ticket but had been taken ill, would
be unable to make the trip. I thought I might
get this ticket a little cheaper. I did save quite
a little by purchasing her ticket, but I was
obliged, on account of the registration of her
name, to come under her name. My enemies have
made much of the fact that I had gone under
Belle Raymond's name. I am sorry now that I
did it after all that has come out in connection
with my terrible experiences. But I hope I will
not be too severely blamed for doing what so
many other people, even business people of integrity,
have been known to do. To travel on another
person's pass is undoubtedly wrong, but it
is not a heinous crime.</p>

<p>Belle Raymond's ticket was for Canada and
not for America direct, but to my mind all the
countries over here were just alike, and as long
as one landed on the west side of the Atlantic
Ocean, I was satisfied. It was all a land of gold
to me. So I went to Montreal on the ticket of
Belle Raymond.</p>

<p>On ship-board I made several acquaintances
among the other Irish girls on board, and they
told me that the best way to get a start on this
side of the water was to get a position as maid
to some great lady and then interest her in lace-making.
Then, they said, I could soon build up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
a good trade for my laces among the people who
had plenty of money to pay for them. They said
that any attempt to sell laces outright would end
in failure, as not one person in 100 knew real
Irish lace when they saw it, and they would
think that I was a fraud unless some great lady
vouched for me.</p>

<p>I did not land directly in Montreal. The last
stage of the journey I performed by train from
Quebec, where I left the steamer. I spent half a
day in Quebec viewing the sights of the city in
company with several other girls. I then took the
train for Montreal where I went directly to the
Young Women's Guild home, where I knew I
would be safe. The Guild secured me a position
with the Thornton family in Belleville, Ontario.</p>

<p>I was overjoyed when I found that I was going
into a great rich family, for they told me that
Mrs. Thornton's father was worth many, many
millions of dollars, and that he controlled the
roller mill business in Canada. This meant that
if I secured Mrs. Thornton as a patroness for
my laces I could get all the rich ladies to buy.</p>

<p>Disappointment awaited me and my dreams
were shattered. I worked nine months as a housemaid.
Mrs. Thornton was not approachable by
servants, although she was uniformly kind and
considerate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>At the Thornton home the disillusions as to the
golden land began to disappear rapidly and my
life settled down to the humdrum of a housemaid's
life. My dreams were shattered. I was
tempted to do wrong on numerous occasions.
Disheartened, I finally left the services of the
family. I was given a letter certifying to my
good character when I quit.</p>

<p>But there was no chance to get started with
my lace-making. I thought perhaps it was because
Belleville was too small a place and that
therefore I would do better if I could get a place
in a big city where I might get a position as lace-maker
in some of the big stores I had heard
about.</p>

<p>I went to Toronto where I worked for about
three weeks. At the end of this time I had almost
given up hope of doing anything with my
lace-making. I was heartsick and almost ready
to go home. I had saved up a little money, however,
enough to take me to Chicago or some big
city in the United States, and still have $40 or
$50 left with which to support myself until I
could get work of some kind. I was on the point
of going back home to Ireland at first, but the
thought that I would get there just about penniless,
and without having done well on this side,
and the thought of what the neighbors would say
and how the other girls would laugh at me, finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
decided me to come to Chicago and make one last
trial at what the Americans call "making good"
before I gave up all hope. This fatal decision
was my ruin. Had I been able to see ahead just
a little, to have looked into that awful hell-pit
of a Wellington hotel&mdash;but there. God ruled
otherwise and perhaps chose me out as an example
and warning.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The First Night.</span></p>


<p>I was practically penniless when I arrived in
Chicago. I knew no one. The magnitude of the
city was fearful to me. For hours I wandered
about knowing not where to go. Exhausted and
frightened, I at last sought shelter in a railway
station. The matron there was kind and talked
encouragingly to me. She soon knew my story.</p>

<p>She took me to the Young Women's Christian
Association and obtained a room for me. In a
few days the officers of the association obtained
a position for me as a maid at the Wellington
hotel. For five weeks I was happy.</p>

<p>In the Wellington hotel was the lace store of
Agnes Barrett. Fine Irish laces were on exhibition.
The wealthy women of the city patronized
the place and almost fabulous prices were
paid for the tiny bits of laces on exhibition.</p>

<p>Agnes Barrett seemed to take an interest in
me. When she learned that I could make the
laces and had won numerous prizes she was delighted.
She asked me to come and work for her.</p>

<p>I was overjoyed at the opportunity. She told
me that all I would have to do would be to sit
in the store and make laces. She said that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
would give the establishment an atmosphere in
the sight of the grand dames. That when they
came to the store to make purchases and saw me
sitting at work making the laces before their eyes,
it would greatly increase the value of them. I
then went to live with Mrs. Linderman, a kind,
motherly woman, who lived at 474 La Salle avenue.</p>

<p>For a long time I was happy. Then Miss
Barrett told me that business was slack and that
she could not employ me steadily. After that,
however, I was in the store quite often. Miss
Barrett seemed to take a great liking for me.
She was so kind and considerate. She petted and
fondled me. Mrs. Cecilia Kenyon and Miss
Donohue were also in the store. All of the
women lived in the Wellington hotel. Miss Donohue
was secretary of the hotel company. They
all seemed to be very prominent. At least fine
dressed men often came into the store to visit
them. They went out to dinners with them and
to the theatres.</p>

<p>To me Miss Barrett and Mrs. Kenyon, who
was her intimate friend, were angels.</p>

<p>Often Miss Barrett took trips away from the
city. She said at those times that she was going
to French Lick Springs, Ind., where she had another
lace store. When she returned she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
show me rolls of bills which she said were the
profits from the store.</p>

<p>She told me that if I were only "wise" like
she, I could have fine clothes and not have to
work much. She said that lots of nice men with
plenty of money were looking for nice girls like
me, to make wives of them.</p>

<p>Her feeling towards me seemed to change almost
in a day.</p>

<p>I became afraid of her. After these outbreaks
I only went to the store when I was compelled
to do so. When I did go she would be extravagant
in her praises of me.</p>

<p>But all this only leads up to the first night.</p>

<p>That awful night, January 4, 1909, will haunt
me to my grave. It was as if the deepest pit of
the very deepest hell had suddenly been transferred
to earth and found lodgment in Chicago.</p>

<p>This night is hard for me to describe. That
I must bare the awful sights to which I was witness
would be inexcusable if I were not trying to
save other girls from the awful fate which awaits
them if they come to the big cities of America
trustful and innocent.</p>

<p>It is left for you who read this whether my attempt
to save others from my dreadful fate is
justifiable.</p>

<p>After the orgies which had taken place while
I was lying helpless and frightened so that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
could scarcely move, I was told that I must be
Miss Barrett's slave for six months. The price
for my slavery was to be $25 cash down, and
$5.00 a day for the term of slavery. I fought
and screamed again at this and said if they did
not let me have my clothes and get out of there
I would get a detective and see what could be
done. They both then told me that I could not
get a detective at that hour of the night.</p>

<p>I was turned out of that hotel near midnight
in the rain without a cent of money in my pockets,
bleeding from the outrages from which I had
suffered and forced to run all the way to my
home in the rain.</p>

<p>I cannot describe the horrible scenes which took
place. I cannot even bear to think of them. I
only know that I fought and screamed and
screamed until they took me to a bath room and
threatened to cut me to pieces. They did cut me.
I kicked and fought and fought and kicked and
screamed until they administered what they
called "knock-out" drops to me and until they cut
me on the arms, face and limbs. It was only
when I became unconscious from the drug that
I ceased fighting them. I fought them even
when they had me tied to the bath tub.</p>

<p>The man torturer I did not recognize. He
was not the man in the velvet mask who tortured
me on the first night. He was smaller. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
O'Shaughnessey, my lawyer at my trial, demanded
that the state in prosecuting me produce a man
named Rohr and asked one of the witnesses if
they knew a man named Anhaltz or Anhalt. I
do not know if either of these was the man who
held me on either occasion.</p>

<p>I do know, however, that the cutting was done
by Miss Barrett herself, and she threatened me
savagely several times, declaring that she would
cut my heart out. The records of my sworn testimony,
both in affidavits and at the trial show
this.</p>

<p>It was while I was being tortured that the
name of a man named Taggart was first heard
by me. Miss Barrett said, "If Tom Taggart
could only see her now." This I swore to on the
witness stand in my trial for stealing lace which
I made myself and I am ready to swear to it
again. Then there was something said about the
"Springs," and Miss Barrett said, "You know
I promised to get them girls like this one." I
was frightened to death by this time and did not
know what to expect.</p>

<p>The story of the horrors of those awful nights
of torture I will never forget. I can not repeat
the happenings of those nights.</p>

<p>To tell that part of the story, I present to the
reader two affidavits which I made as I lay, suffering
from my awful treatment, on a cot at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Frances Willard Memorial hospital. They are
the substance of my testimony in court:</p>

<p>Ella Gingles, being first duly sworn, deposes
and says:</p>

<p>That, about seven o'clock on the evening of
January 4th, 1909, she returned from a trip
down-town to her room at 474 La Salle Avenue,
Chicago, and there found Agnes Barrett, alias
Madame Barette, and Mrs. Kenyon waiting.</p>

<p>That they said they had been waiting about
four hours for her but that she found afterwards
they had been waiting about an hour; that they
told this affiant they had come out there in a
cab, but dismissed the cab before affiant arrived
home, which was near seven o'clock in the evening;
that they came up to affiant's room and that
Agnes Barrett, alias Madame Barette, asked affiant
to give her a collar that affiant had been
enlarging for her and affiant told her she had not
yet finished it, to which she replied that the
woman to whom it belonged was about to leave
town and could not wait for it.</p>

<p>Affiant then went to the bureau and took out
the collar and gave it to her, when she said that
she wanted the rest of the lace, and affiant told
her she had not given affiant any more lace to
do; she then said that if affiant did not give her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the lace she would take it and search the room,
whereupon affiant says that they, the two women
aforesaid, did search affiant's room and took all
the lace affiant had except what was in her little
work-box, which they did not touch.</p>

<p>That they took a yard of crepe lace that was
an original design and with which affiant won a
prize in Belfast, a plate mat that was an original
design, and with which affiant won a prize in
Larne, Ireland, and a necklace with an amethyst
drop of a few stones that affiant's mother bought
for her in London and gave her the Christmas
before affiant left home, at which time she bought
another with blue stones and gave it to affiant's
other sister; that they also took all the money that
affiant had, consisting of a Canadian dollar, four
American paper dollars and a dollar in change,
took affiant's watch, her bank book showing a deposit
of forty dollars in Canada, and a sofa top
and cushion and many other things.</p>

<p>Affiant further says that said Agnes Barrett,
alias Madame Barette, then asked her to let her
look at affiant's trunk, in which affiant then told
her she had nothing of hers, but which she insisted
upon seeing; affiant then went to Mrs.
Linderman, the landlady, and got a candle and
took the aforesaid two women down in the basement
and opened the trunk.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kenyon held the candle, and Agnes Barrett,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
alias Madame Barette, went through affiant's
trunk and took a pair of long, white stockings,
a pair of white gloves, some chiffon, and
then Mrs. Kenyon dropped grease from the candle
all over anything of any value and the two
women aforesaid then tramped the rest of the
clothes into the floor, ruining them.</p>

<p>Affiant further says that up to that time, Agnes
Barrett, alias Madame Barette, did not claim
that any of the stuff was stolen, but that after
she brought what was downstairs upstairs and
put all of it into a pillow-slip, she said to affiant,
"Sure this is all mine." Affiant says that among
the things which they took were five medallions,
seven of which affiant still possess, having been
made twelve in number for a Roman Catholic
altar cloth.</p>

<p>Affiant further says that after remaining in
the room for two hours or more, joking and
laughing and fooling away time, that some time
after nine o'clock this affiant was ordered to take
up the bag that they had filled with affiant's own
goods and carry them down to the Wellington
Hotel, and this affiant went, carrying them down
on the promise that when they got to the Wellington
Hotel the stuff would be given back or
the ownership settled.</p>

<p>This affiant says she went down that she might
settle her dispute with said Agnes Barrett, alias<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Madame Barette, and bring back her own stuff
to her own home; that the three, Agnes Barrett,
alias Madame Barette, Mrs. Kenyon and this affiant,
reached the Wellington Hotel and went
into the room of said Agnes Barrett, alias Madame
Barette, some time in the neighborhood of
half-past nine o'clock, or maybe somewhat later,
having gone down in the street car; and that
when they went in Mrs. Kenyon locked the door
to the said Barrett room.</p>

<p>The two women then whispered together in a
low tone and Agnes Barrett, alias Madame Barette,
asked this affiant to take off her clothes, and
she refused.</p>

<p>Agnes Barrett, alias Madame Barette, then
said to affiant, "You might have something that
belongs to me," to which affiant replied that she
did not, whereupon said Agnes Barrett, alias
Madame Barette, said, "I will take them off for
you," and she and Mrs. Kenyon then took off
affiant's clothes, stripping her with the exception
of her shoes.</p>

<p>Affiant says that in taking off the waist a
safety pin in affiant's back hurt her and she
screamed, whereupon said Agnes Barrett, alias
Madame Barette, seized this affiant by the throat
and told her she would choke her to death if affiant
made any outcry.</p>

<p>After stripping affiant, Agnes Barrett, alias<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Madame Barette, said to Mrs. Kenyon, "If only
&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;and another man whose name affiant
does not remember&mdash;"were here now to see this,"
and Mrs. Kenyon said, "Who are they," to which
she replied, "They are the men that I told you
about."</p>

<p>The affiant says Agnes Barrett, alias Madame
Barette, said to her, "I know a nice gentleman
that wants to get you to live with him," to which
affiant replied that she did not want to get married,
upon which the two women laughed and
said, "Nobody is asking you to get married; you
would only have to live with someone a little
while and you would get plenty of money for
it."</p>

<p>Affiant further says that said Agnes Barrett,
alias Madame Barette, then told Mrs. Kenyon
to hold this affiant, and Mrs. Kenyon grabbed
her from behind, putting her arms through affiant's
arms from behind.</p>

<p>The affiant also says that Agnes Barrett then
said, "She will do."</p>

<p>Miss Barrett went to the telephone and called
up Miss Donohue's room. Miss Donohue was
not in her room.</p>

<p>(The affidavit follows for four pages of revolting
details.)</p>

<p>Miss Barrett and Mrs. Kenyon, she says, were
unclothed, a short time later when a man came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the room. When he knocked, affiant says, the
two women put on night gowns and left her entirely
uncovered. She says Miss Barrett asked
him what kept him when he was allowed to enter
the room and he replied he could not get there
any sooner.</p>

<p>She says his face was covered with a black
mask.</p>

<p>Affiant says he attacked her and was assisted
in this by Mrs. Kenyon.</p>

<p>The affiant says that after some time the telephone
rang and Mrs. Kenyon answered it and
it was for the man and he called up and said, "Is
that you, Charley?"</p>

<p>The affiant says she does not know what was
said back but that the man then said, "Yes, she
is here," and he told this man over the phone,
"Yes, it is all right, Charlie, she is here," and
added that he would be back soon.</p>

<p>He then said over the telephone, "Yes, I will
just come right away," and that after that he put
on his clothes and left, but that Agnes Barrett
and Mrs. Kenyon remained in the room.</p>

<p>The affiant further says that before the man
went out Agnes Barrett asked him when he
would give her the money and he said, "Well,
sure, we are to come tomorrow night," and added
that he would bring the money then and then left.
The affiant says that she then asked Agnes Barrett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
for her clothes. These, she says, were given
her after a time.</p>

<p>The affiant then says Miss Barrett told her to
come down the next night at five o'clock and offered
her a silk dress if she would do as she bid,
and that she then took the silk dress out of the
wardrobe and showed it to her, but affiant refused
it.</p>

<p>That she then said that if affiant would come
down tomorrow she would get it fixed for this affiant
and that she would have things ready for
this affiant to go down to the Springs. She
further told this affiant that she, this affiant, was
to go to French Lick Springs and was to stay
there about a week.</p>

<p>She further stated that while this affiant was
at the hotel she was not to dress in the morning,
but put on a kimono and to dress in the evening,
that she was to remain in her room in the afternoon.</p>

<p>This affiant says that Mrs. Kenyon then asked
Agnes Barrett, alias Madame Barette, what
about the "last one," to which she replied, "Well,
they have tired of her; they had her long
enough." She then told this affiant that she was
to do whatever she would want her to for six
months and that this affiant was to come down
there the next day to sign a paper.</p>

<p>She told this affiant that she was to be down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
there about three months, and that she then was
going to send this affiant some place else, but she
did not say where, but said that this affiant could
sell lace for her after that.</p>

<p>Affiant further says that she did not take any
money that night, but that the said Agnes Barrett,
alias Madame Barette, promised to give her
back all the things she took from this affiant if
affiant would come down there the next day at
five o'clock.</p>

<p>Affiant says that when said Agnes Barrett,
alias Madame Barette, gave affiant her clothes,
affiant said that if she did not give her the rest
of her things she would go to a detective.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kenyon said that affiant could not get a
detective at that time of night. She says that
night Agnes Barrett, alias Madame Barette,
made her sign two papers; the contents of neither
was read to this affiant, nor was she allowed to
see them, and the condition of signing the papers
was to get her clothes.</p>

<p>The affiant says that Agnes Barrett then held
up the two papers and said, "Anybody would believe
me with these papers and Mrs. Kenyon."
Affiant says she then asked Agnes Barrett, alias
Madame Barette for a nickel to ride home, as
she had kept all of affiant's money, and she refused
it and said the walk would do affiant good.
That when affiant went out she came with her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the elevator and said, "Be sure and come tomorrow
at five o'clock." Affiant says that she then
went out without any money and ran home most
of the way.</p>

<p>Affiant says that on the next day she did not
return to the hotel, but went and told Captain
O'Brien; that the enormity of the situation was
such that she could not tell it, and told the first
part of it; that she did not reach Captain
O'Brien's office until nearly five o'clock in the
evening because she was ill from the outrages
and indignities and sights of the night before;
that she was unable to go out until late in the day;
that the story itself was so horrible that she did
not tell it to any man, but told parts of it to
different women who are interested in her.</p>

<p>I, Ella Gingles, now make this affidavit, not
to save myself or to help myself, knowing well
that my ruination is well-nigh complete if horrible
sights and acts and degradations that I cannot
describe can work my disgrace; and I make
this affidavit not in revenge, but because I have
been attacked twice in the Wellington Hotel and
because I know that no girl can be safe who like
myself has no protectors.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Arrested!</span></p>


<p>After the horrible outrages of January 4 I did
not know what to do. I was without money, and
I would have been without food if Mrs. Lindermann
had not kindly given me something to eat.
I could not bear to think of telling any one, even
a police officer or my kind landlady, of the horrors
of that night.</p>

<p>Finally on the afternoon of Thursday, January
8, I did make up my mind that I would not
say anything about the horrors of the case, but
would go to the chief of detectives, Captain P. D.
O'Brien, and tell him of the stealing of my things
from my rooms and ask him to get my things
back for me. I went to the captain and told him
my story. He seemed impressed by it, took me
to his home that night for supper, lodged me, and
the next day, which was Friday, ordered the
women at the Wellington hotel to bring back the
things which they had stolen from me.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of Friday Mrs. Kenyon, who
has since died under the mysterious circumstances,
came over alone. Miss Barrett did not come.
The captain ordered her to bring the things over
with her and to have Miss Barrett come over by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
noon of the next day. The next day I went back
to the captain's office and they both came over.
They brought with them only a part of the things
they had taken from my room and they also put
in some things which had never been in my room.
I told Captain O'Brien so when I looked over the
lot. We went over everything piece by piece,
and only four small pieces of lace was there any
difference of opinion, Miss Barrett admitting
that the rest of the things belonged to me. I was
allowed to take them away.</p>

<p>Captain O'Brien then asked Miss Barrett
whether she was going to prosecute me for theft,
and asked her if she was to get the warrant out
before all the offices closed so that I could get bail
that night and would not have to spend the Sunday
in jail. Miss Barrett declared that they had
no intention of pushing the prosecution, and we
all supposed the case was then over, except myself.
I intended to get my other things back in
time, if I had to sue for them.</p>

<p>We all then left Captain O'Brien's office. I
was astounded that night to be arrested at about
eleven o'clock on a warrant sworn out by Miss
Barrett, charging me with having stolen the four
pieces of lace valued at fifty dollars. I was taken
to the Harrison street police station. Here I
was compelled to spend the night in a filthy cell.</p>

<p>I understood later that it was the next morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
that Captain O'Brien called up Attorney Patrick
H. O'Donnell and asked him to come down to the
station and get out my bond and take up my case.
Mr. O'Donnell did come, and he did get me out
on bail furnished by Samuel Feldmann. Mr.
Feldmann came to go on my bail at Mr. O'Donnell's
solicitation and that of Captain O'Brien, as
I understand it, although of this particular point
I am not sure. At any rate, I was released on
bail pending a hearing on the charge, which subsequently
took place in the municipal court before
Judge Hume.</p>

<p>Mr. O'Donnell kindly took me to his home, and
his wife there cried over and mothered me and
was as good to me as my own mother could have
been. Up to this time I had given no hint of the
horrors of January 4. I could not bear to think
of them, much less speak of them. Mr. O'Donnell
did not know. No one except those present
and myself knew of these things.</p>

<p>Then the people of Chicago began to come to
my aid because I was poor and friendless. The
Irish Fellowship Club employed Attorney John
Patrick O'Shaughnessey to take up my case and
investigate it.</p>

<p>I was taken to the office of Mr. O'Shaughnessey
and was told that he, as well as Mr. O'Donnell,
would be my friend. Mr. O'Shaughnessey
was rather cross to me at first and seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
doubt whether or not I could make any lace. He
seemed to fear that I was a common thief, and
not a real lace-maker. He said to me, "Can you
make lace?"</p>

<p>I told him, "Yes, I can make lace of any ordinary
pattern known as Irish lace." He said to
me, "You sit right down there in that chair and
make some lace, if you can make lace." I replied
that I had no thread.</p>

<p>Mr. O'Shaughnessey then sent out and got
some thread of the kinds which I told him to get,
and I sat down and worked with the thread for
several hours making lace. At the end of the
time I was able to show Mr. O'Shaughnessey a
piece of the grape-vine pattern, which is well
known in Ireland, and which is the pattern which
I used when I won my prizes in my native home
of Larne for lace-making. It was the same kind
of lace which I had made on one or two occasions
for Miss Barrett at the Wellington hotel. The
pattern agreed with some of the pieces of lace
which I was accused of having stolen from the
Wellington hotel.</p>

<p>This exhibition of my powers to make lace convinced
Mr. O'Shaughnessey that I was not a
fraud, and that I could do what I had claimed
that I could do. From that time forward he became
my active friend and fought hard for me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
clear to the end of the terrible trial to which I
was subjected.</p>

<p>Subsequently I was compelled to make lace in
the presence of a number of ladies who were interested
in my case, just to show them that I was
not a fraud. Every one seemed to be suspicious
of me until I had proved that I could make lace
and that I was not lying. I did not and never
have had a single friend who has not compelled
me to give some definite proof or other either as
to lace-making ability or my character since this
whole horrible matter came out.</p>

<p>After my experience in proving to Mr.
O'Shaughnessey that I was not a fraud I was
taken to Mr. O'Donnell's home and there cared
for by his wife. Mrs. O'Donnell, who seemed to
be about the only person to believe in me from
the first, even when her husband seemed to doubt
me, took good care of me and treated me as if I
were her own daughter. After Mr. O'Donnell
had satisfied himself that I was all right, and that
there was no fraud in any of my stories, he, too,
was very kind and allowed me to come down to
his office to visit with Miss Mary Joyce, his stenographer,
who used to chat with me while I made
lace with which to pay at least a part of my obligations
to the O'Donnells.</p>

<p>It was here, in this office, away up in the air
at the Ashland block, that I made lace day after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
day. I could only make one or two collars and a
tie or so a week, but that little brought in something,
as I had some exclusive Irish patterns of
my own which attracted trade. These patterns
of mine could not be duplicated, at least in America,
and the lace which I made has always attracted
attention. One of my customers for the lace
which I made at this time was Miss Sarah M.
Hopkins of the Catholic Women's League of
Chicago. She bought several ties from me and
became interested in me at this period of my troubles,
before the brutal second attack at the Wellington
hotel.</p>

<p>When Miss Hopkins and other ladies became
patrons of mine I thought I saw a way to make
a good living without having to work as a housemaid
any more, and that I could use the trade
which I had learned in Ireland to good advantage.
It was the first chance I had really had to
show what I could do since I had left the old
country, and I felt very thankful for it.</p>

<p>The days dragged by very slowly for me, for
they kept putting off the case of trying me for
lace-stealing, stealing the lace I had made myself,
from time to time, and some days I cried and
cried because the case was not over and I was not
free, because I did not believe that anybody
would convict me of stealing my own property,
especially after the manner in which it was taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>I remember one day I was crying my eyes out
on the couch in Mr. O'Donnell's law office when
Miss Mary Joyce, the best girl friend I have ever
known, came in and tried to quiet me. I cried
more and more until a gentleman came in, I think
he was a reporter, and then I managed to quit
crying until he left. Miss Joyce told him to get
out of the place until I was quiet, and he went.
After he had gone I began to cry again, and Miss
Joyce said not to cry, that some time soon I
would be back in Ireland again with the home
folks. That only made me cry more, because I
did not see how I could face the people at home
after the terrible things that had happened to me
and after I had been arrested.</p>

<p>Long and long those awful days dragged out
from January 9 until February 6. I do not believe
that there was a single day that I did not
cry until my eyes were all red, and I know that
on many a night during that time I cried myself
to sleep. I could not bear to think of the shame
that had befallen me, although I knew that it was
no fault of my own that it had happened to me.</p>

<p>It was all a nightmare. My nerves were breaking
gradually under the terrible strain.</p>

<p>Then came my hearing before Judge Hume of
the municipal court. I was arraigned on the
larceny charge and after Miss Barrett and I had
testified my attorneys demanded that I be held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
to the grand jury, and refused to cross-examine
the witnesses for the prosecution, so convinced
were they of my innocence.</p>

<p>When this was done Miss Barrett was heard
to say, "Oh, my, this is awful." This remark
was overheard by Mr. O'Shaughnessey and convinced
him more than ever that something was
being hidden and that I was not the thief the
Wellington hotel people sought to make me out.</p>

<p>During this trial an attempt on the part of
Mrs. Kenyon to coach Miss Barrett while she was
on the stand brought forth some strong objections
from Mr. O'Shaughnessey, and Mrs. Kenyon
was compelled to stop attempting to coach
Miss Barrett from the floor of the courtroom.</p>

<p>When they tried to make out their case against
me at this hearing they brought a number of
pieces of lace which had never been in Captain
O'Brien's office or in my room, and I said so, and
Attorney O'Donnell promptly had them impounded
for the purpose of disproving the charge
against me later on. He would not let them
have them back, nor would he let them have back
a pair of stockings of Miss Donahue's which they
said I had stolen. This was the first injection of
Miss Donahue's name into the case, but it was
brought in later after the second attack on me in
the Wellington hotel.</p>

<p>At this preliminary hearing I was held on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
demand of my own people to the grand jury and
was subsequently indicted on their demand that
I might be enabled to effectually clear my name.
This was the opening of the larceny case, where
the alleged theft of $25 worth of lace has caused
the expenditure of more than $38,000 all told in
prosecution and defense of me, a little Irish working
girl.</p>

<p>The second affidavit of Ella Gingles covering
the incidents of the second night following her
arrest is a story of a grewsome tragedy. It was
made as she lay on a cot in the Frances Willard
Memorial hospital in Chicago.</p>

<p>The affidavit, signed by herself and sworn to,
is as follows:</p>

<table summary="scaffold">
<tr><td class="tdc">

County of Cook.

<td style="font-size: 200%;">}</td>

</table>

<p>Ella Gingles, being first duly sworn, deposes
and says:</p>

<p>That on the ninth day of February, 1909, she
was arrested, charged with the larceny of jewelry
and lace in the city of Chicago, and that the
complaining witness was one Agness Barrett,
alias Madame Barette, and that on the following
day she was taken out on bail and became represented
by Patrick H. O'Donnell of Chicago, and
a day or two thereafter also by John P.
O'Shaughnessey. The affiant further says that
she had a hearing thereon.</p>

<p>Your affiant says that on Tuesday, February
16, 1909, this affiant came in the afternoon to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
office of Patrick H. O'Donnell, 911 Ashland
block, and there sat in the office making lace for
one hour and then had a talk with Attorney
O'Donnell in his private office, and then left his
office a few minutes before five o'clock p. m., but
stopped at the elevator in said building to talk
to Mr. O'Donnell and Miss Sarah Hopkins.</p>

<p>That as she left the said building she had in her
pocketbook, among other small change, a five
dollar bill, and that this affiant went from the
office to the store on State street known as Carson,
Pirie, Scott &amp; Co., and went in there and
bought a spool of thread for crocheting purposes,
and paid forty cents therefor and gave the five
dollar bill to be changed in making said payment;
and this affiant says she is ready to exhibit
her purchase slip showing the purchase and the
amount of money offered in payment therefor;
and this affiant says that the hour of said purchase
was almost five o'clock on the evening of the sixteenth,
and that as this affiant approached the
door of said store a cab was standing at the curb
and Agnes Barrett, alias Madame Barette,
stepped out of said cab and started toward the
store and left a man sitting in the cab waiting,
but that this affiant did not see where Agnes Barrett,
alias Madame Barette, went, or did not see
her make subsequent purchases.</p>

<p>This affiant further says that after making said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
purchase she returned home to her room at 474
La Salle avenue, Chicago, and there placed the
one key to the door of her room in a secret place
where her sister might find it, and which place
was known to herself and her sister, and the secret
place was on the stairs under the stair carpet.</p>

<p>After concealing said key, and before the sister
so returned, and after entering her room and
turning out the gas stove, she retraced her steps
and started back to room 545, Wellington hotel,
to collect from a Miss Arnold three dollars that
said Miss Arnold owed this affiant; and that on
two separate occasions theretofore this affiant undertook
to collect said money; once while in company
with Miss Mary E. Joyce and later while
in company with Mrs. Bagshaw and Miss Sarah
Hopkins, but that she was persuaded not to try
to make such collections by both parties.</p>

<p>This affiant says she is familiar with the Wellington
hotel and had worked in said hotel for
about a week, and while she worked there said
Miss Arnold did occupy said room, and that
Agnes Barrett, alias Madame Barette, lived on
the second floor in said hotel, in room number
228; and that this affiant, when she went to said
hotel, did not know that Miss Arnold had moved
out of room 545, when in fact she had, and, as
your affiant is now informed, had left the hotel
on the 12th of the preceding month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>This affiant did not know that Agnes Barrett,
alias Madame Barette, had left the second floor
and had moved up into the identical room 545,
but your affiant is informed that such is the fact.
And this affiant did go to room 545, believing
that she was approaching the room of Miss Arnold
and not knowing that she was approaching
the room of Agnes Barrett, alias Madame Barette,
and knocked on the door, the exact time of
which this affiant does not know, but believes
that it was in the neighborhood of half past six
o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>This affiant says that a man stepped out of said
room and asked this affiant what she wanted, and
this affiant said she wanted to see Miss Arnold.
The man said, "Is it about anything in particular?"
and this affiant said, "It is about lace," and
the man said that she was expecting this affiant,
and to wait a minute. He talked to somebody
in the room and then came out and said Miss
Arnold was in the bathroom, and this affiant said
she would wait until she came back.</p>

<p>The man said she was only brushing her
clothes, and this affiant went around to the bathroom
and he followed her around, and this affiant
knocked at the door, which was a little ajar, and
he pushed open the door and pushed this affiant
in the bathroom and put a wet handkerchief in
her mouth, on which handkerchief, this affiant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
says, there was some burning stuff that was
sweet, and it was "cold, but burning," after which
affiant says she did not know any more.</p>

<p>Affiant says that this was not the bathroom she
was subsequently found in, but was the bathroom
around by Miss Barrett's room, that affiant then
thought was Miss Arnold's room.</p>

<p>Affiant further says she does not remember
subsequent events until this affiant woke up lying
on a bed entirely undressed with the exception of
her stockings, and was being guarded by a man.</p>

<p>This affiant asked, "What is the matter with
my head; what is the matter here, and what is
wrong?"</p>

<p>The man answered this affiant and said, "You
are in Miss Barrett's room; you told something
that Miss Barrett did not want you to tell and
she is going to kill you, and if you scream we will
kill you." At that time this affiant saw nobody
except the man himself.</p>

<p>He said he was going after Miss Barrett, who
was in the hall, and he went to the hall and locked
the door after him, and then this affiant looked
for her clothes and could not find any, but found
a pocketbook belonging to her on the bureau, and
there was a lead pencil in it, and this affiant
wrote on an envelope:</p>

<p>"I am at the Wellington hotel; come quick."</p>

<p>But did not sign her name in full, merely signing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
her first name, "Ella," and then put it in an
envelope, and after affixing two stamps wrote on
the outside, "Bellboy please mail this," and then
got up on a chair and threw it over the transom
towards the next door, room number 547.</p>

<p>Affiant says that the reason she did not call on
the telephone was because she did not remember
Mr. O'Donnell's telephone number and she did
not see any telephone, and that she could not
have called on the telephone anyway if this man
was still outside, and she did not want to alarm
him or notify him, because he said she was not
to move or get up, and said that he would kill
her if she got up from the bed.</p>

<p>Affiant says that at this time she had nothing
on except her stockings, and that when she got
down from the chair she put Miss Barrett's
spread around her, and that man above referred
to then came back in and asked her what she had
been doing and she replied that she had not been
doing anything. Affiant says that the man then
attacked her. When she screamed the man hit
her on the head with his fist at the root of the hair
over the right eye, and the resultant wound was
the wound found on her by the doctors later.</p>

<p>Affiant further says that the man referred to
then offered her ten dollars after striking her, and
tried to tear the spread off of her, but that this
affiant screamed for help, and that the man then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
got a towel or some cloth and bound her mouth
with a gag, and that this affiant could not prevent
said binding. Miss Barrett came in, and he then
sat down and wrote several letters or papers and
watched this affiant for several hours. Late in
the night he presented some paper to this affiant
to sign and told her he would kill her if she did
not, but this affiant does not know what the paper
was and has never heard of it since.</p>

<p>This affiant further says that on the second occasion
that the man attacked her this affiant
pulled the gag off her mouth and screamed for
help again, but the man bound her mouth, and
she so sat with her mouth bound until about two
o'clock in the morning. Affiant says that there
was a knock at the door and the man put out the
light and went to the door, and that Agnes Barrett,
alias Madame Barette, and another woman
came in, and that the man asked the said Barrett
what kept her.</p>

<p>Agnes Barrett, alias Madame Barette, then
asked the man if this affiant was there yet, to
which he replied yes, and that then the aforesaid
Agnes Barrett, alias Madame Barette, said
that she could not help staying, saying something
about a game of cards.</p>

<p>The man then asked the said Agnes Barrett,
alias Madame Barette, if she brought the wine
with her, to which she replied that she had, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
that she did not have a corkscrew, and asked the
man if he went out to straighten up the bathroom,
to which he replied that he did, and said Agnes
Barrett, alias Madame Barette, then said that
she went into the bathroom as she was leaving the
hotel and found a hatpin in it, and that was all.</p>

<p>Affiant says that the man then gave the said
Agnes Barrett, alias Madame Barette, a pocket
knife with a corkscrew in it, and that they pulled
the cork out of the bottle and drank some of the
contents. Affiant says she did not know what
was in the bottle or whether the wine was red or
white. Affiant says that the said man, Agnes
Barrett, alias Madame Barette, and the woman
that came with her as aforesaid had lighted a
candle before they opened the bottle, and that
after they had partaken of the contents thereof
as aforesaid the man went out of the room, but
that previous to that he offered the said Agnes
Barrett, alias Madame Barette, fifty dollars, and
that the said Agnes Barrett said that was not
enough.</p>

<p>Affiant says that that was all the man said at
the time, and that he then gave to said Agnes
Barrett, alias Madame Barette, fifty dollars, who
did not then say any more, but took the money.
That the man then went out of the room and took
the bottle with him, and also the candle lighting
the room. Agnes Barrett, alias Madame Barette,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
then turned on the light and came over to this
affiant, who was sitting on the bed, and removed
the gag from affiant's mouth and said to this
affiant:</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you I would kill you if you
would tell your lawyer the things she told me."</p>

<p>"I did not tell the attorney," I replied. Agnes
Barrett then asked affiant if affiant had told him
the man's name down at the Springs, to which
affiant replied that she had.</p>

<p>She then said: "Did you tell that interrupting
beast?"</p>

<p>When I asked her who she meant, she said:
"That other lawyer of yours."</p>

<p>I said, "I did not tell him anything."</p>

<p>I asked her who brought me there, saying that
she did not remember coming there.</p>

<p>The man then came in and said that he was
going to fix my head and give me something for
it. They asked me to go to Miss Donahue's room
and I refused.</p>

<p>Affiant further says that Agnes Barrett then
took two night-dresses out of a paper and put
one on her and then took her in to the man she
claimed was a doctor to the bathroom. The other
woman came out of the room after them and
locked the door and brought the key with her, and
that they then all went into the bathroom.</p>

<p>This affiant says that Miss Donahue was talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
over the back transom to the man inside the
bathroom. Affiant says that a candle was then
lighted in the bathroom and that Miss Donahue
reached a little bottle through the transom and
told said Agnes Barrett, alias Madame Barette,
to mix it.</p>

<p>Affiant said she did not know what it was and
refused to take it, whereupon the man poured it
out in a glass and put it to this affiant's mouth
and made her drink it. Affiant says that she did
not know who the man in the bathroom was at
that time, because he had a black mask tied over
his face, and that she did not know whether this
man was a doctor or not, but that Agnes Barrett
called him doctor.</p>

<p>She further says that after drinking the medicine
or drug, as above stated, she became sick,
and that Agnes Barrett then asked the man if
he had any knockout drops.</p>

<p>The man replied that he had not.</p>

<p>Agnes Barrett then said she had some, and
went out of the room and shortly afterward came
back with what appeared to be candy. They then
made affiant drink more of the aforesaid wine and
then told affiant to eat some of the supposed
candy in order to get the taste out of affiant's
mouth, and that she did so.</p>

<p>Affiant says the supposed candy was sweet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
was hard on the outside and soft on the inside,
and was of a greenish color.</p>

<p>She says that after this she could not keep her
eyes open and could not remember anything
more, but that they were still in the bathroom,
and when affiant awakened she was on the bathroom
floor.</p>

<p>(Here the affidavit recites the revolting details,
unprintable in nature, which occurred in the bathroom
on the fifth floor of the Wellington hotel.)</p>

<p>The affiant says that when she awakened she
was not yet tied, and that the man had his coat
off and his face uncovered. Agnes Barrett was
standing in the room. The affiant says that
Madame Barette cut her on the arms and wrists
several times. She says she struggled and that
the other woman then asked the said Agnes Barrett
why she did not tie the affiant's hands, to
which she replied that she did not have anything
there to tie them with, but that she then got the
key to her room from the other woman and went
out, and returned with cords, etc., and that the
other woman then held the affiant's hands while
Agnes Barrett tied them behind the affiant's
head, and tied them to the legs of the bathtub,
and that the man then tied the affiant's leg, which
the aforesaid Agnes Barrett held until he tied.
She says that Agnes Barrett then said that she
had not got enough cords with her, but she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
a piece of black cloth or stocking, or something
black, with which she tied affiant's leg, and also
tied her ankle with some sort of a cord. She
says that her left leg was left untied and that her
mouth was also tied. The affiant then says that
the man and Agnes Barrett then both attacked
her.</p>

<p>She says that the strange woman held her
shoulders to the floor and Agnes Barrett held the
leg that was loose while the man took the knife
and cut her several times. She says she did not
bleed freely and Agnes Barrett then ordered the
man to cut her on the other side. The man then
assaulted her. He said he cut her to arouse his
passions.</p>

<p>She says they were in the room for some time
after that and that the man then told Agnes Barrett
to go for his overcoat, and she said for him
to come back at five o'clock.</p>

<p>Affiant further says that the said Agnes Barrett,
alias Madame Barette, then asked the man
to come to her room and stay the remainder of
the night, but he said no, that he had somebody to
see before he left the city.</p>

<p>Agnes Barrett then told the man to be there
and awaken them when he came at five o'clock,
and not to sleep late, because she said he was to
have a cab with him to take this affiant to Louisville
with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>The affiant then declared that she would not
go to Louisville with the man.</p>

<p>Affiant then says Agnes Barrett put the neck
of the bottle in her mouth and made her drink
the rest of the contents, and also gave her some
more of the supposed candy, and then tied up
affiant's mouth again.</p>

<p>Agnes Barrett told the man to leave the light
on so that the people would think there was somebody
in the bathroom, and they then left affiant
lying drugged on the floor of the room.</p>

<p>Affiant further says that the man then climbed
up over the transom; that she saw him get up;
that she saw that he had one leg over, and that
she then could keep awake no longer; that she
was sleepy and did not know what happened
after that.</p>

<p>Affiant further says that at the time the liquid
was poured from the little bottle into the big one,
as above narrated, that the man told said Agnes
Barrett, alias Madame Barette, to scrape the label
off the bottle and she took the knife that the
corkscrew was attached to and scraped at the
label of the wine bottle.</p>

<p>Affiant further says that after the man had attacked
this affiant the first time, as hereinbefore
narrated, that the said Agnes Barrett, alias
Madame Barette, said to him, "Fifty dollars is
not enough for this girl," and he then said, "That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
is all I paid for the last one," and added, "Look
at the bother you gave me with the last one,"
and she said, "Yes, but you won't have any bother
with this one."</p>

<p>This affiant further says there are many incidents
and things that happened from the time
she was first seized in the bathroom until the man
climbed up out over the transom that she has not
narrated in this affidavit, but that she has told
most of the occurrences; and also says that the
clothes she wore that night were later returned to
her by the police.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">ELLA GINGLES ON TRIAL.</p>

<p class="small center">BY HAL M'LEOD LYTLE.</p>


<p>Was Ella Gingles, the little blonde Irish lace-maker,
on trial for stealing $50 worth of lace
from Agnes Barrett?</p>

<p>Or was the city of Chicago on trial for permitting
an unsophisticated girl to be made the victim
of a criminal corporation with its headquarters in
another state, as Miss Gingles has sworn?</p>

<p>No more remarkable case was ever tried in the
criminal court of Cook county, wherein some of
the most amazing cases of which the world has
record have been heard and decided.</p>

<p>Ella Gingles was charged with larceny. Ella
Gingles asserted that the charge against her was
inspired by an intent on the part of her accusers
to brand her a thief so that her story of the criminal
machinations of a gang operating in the interest
of a combination against law and order,
with headquarters at an Indiana resort, might
escape the penalty of acts committed by its
agents.</p>

<p>The jury which heard Ella Gingles' story was
not misled by any rhetorical bombast or alleged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
expert testimony covering the coined phrase,
"mythomania."</p>

<p>Miss Gingles was supposed to have the hysterical
tendency developed to the extent that she
imagined things happened and then believed they
had happened.</p>

<p>There are such people, but they are not of the
physical or mental make-up of Ella Gingles. Dr.
Krohn has had, no doubt, a vast experience of
hysteria, basing the theory on his Kankakee connection,
but he reckoned without the jury if he
believed that the clear-eyed, self-poised young
woman who told that horrible story to the court
involving Agnes Barrett and Cecelia Kenyon
with the "man in the velvet mask," was a victim
of hysteria.</p>

<p>The testimony of Ella Gingles was of a sort
that might be heard in a French court and understood.
If it were heard in an English court, and
believed, the plaintiffs would be certain of twenty
years at hard labor without appeal.</p>

<p>In the criminal court of Chicago the prosecution
was placed in a strange position. Ella Gingles,
charged with a crime against the state, no
matter by whom, it was the duty of the state's
attorney's office to prosecute her with all the resources
of that office.</p>

<p>Across the river they are used to meeting steel
with steel. They fight with the weapons that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the enemy uses. They perhaps become too inured
to the idea that everybody is guilty until
proved innocent. Therefore the cross-examination
of Ella Gingles by Mr. Short, legitimate
enough if the young woman were the double-dyed
criminal he appears to believe her, fell short of its
intended effect with the jury that leaned forward,
every man listening with hand over ear for the
lightest word of the softest-spoken witness the
criminal court had seen in many a day.</p>

<p>Mr. Short was too clever an advocate to believe
that the racking cross-examination covering hideous
detail of the behavior of Miss Barrett and the
dead Mrs. Kenyon, which brought tears to the
eyes of the shrinking witness, could add anything
to the state's contention in this case.</p>

<p>Ella Gingles was ingenuous to a fault. She
answered questions put to her in cross-examination
without an instant's hesitation, and with the
utmost candor. An apparent discrepancy seized
on by the lawyers opposing her and questions
thundered at her in denunciatory tone fell flat.
The question sounded subtle.</p>

<p>"Ah!" whispered the doubter in the spectator's
row. "Here is where she betrays herself."</p>

<p>Then, without an instant's pause, the girl told
just what happened. She had been told that she
must talk out&mdash;just as though she were talking
to her mother&mdash;and so she told everything. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
was a difficult situation for a prosecuting lawyer.</p>

<p>But if Ella Gingles was ingenuous, Ella Gingles
was no fool. She knew that she was on the
defensive.</p>

<p>Still, it was not to be wondered at that the Ella
Gingles case proved a puzzle to the Chicago police
and the state's attorney's office. The young
woman appeared to have a thorough knowledge
of the pitfalls that beset young womanhood in
certain directions, and to be grossly ignorant of
those that girls of less maturity in Chicago might
be expected to avoid.</p>

<p>When, in the course of her examination, it developed
that Ella Gingles was thinking in the
way of a foreigner in a strange place while the
state's advocate was cross-examining her as
though she had been born and bred in Chicago, or
at least in America, the assurance of the defendant
charged with a crime was remarkable.</p>

<p>If at any time it should develop that Ella Gingles
has lied throughout, that she was never attacked
in the Wellington hotel&mdash;that Miss Barrett
is not guilty of the charges made against
her and that the weird story of conspiracy was
born in a clever brain, rehearsed and then put on
like any melodramatic bit for the delectation of
a surfeited public it will go hard with the girl.</p>

<p>Miss Gingles was gowned in the most simple
style. Her fresh, unpainted face and her wide-staring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
innocent eyes were of the sort seldom involved
in a case of this kind.</p>

<p>When asked an involved question in cross-examination
she half hesitated, looked quickly at
judge and jury, flashed a glance of inquiry at her
lawyer and blushed.</p>

<p>Blushing is an accomplishment. It impresses
a jury tremendously. Miss Gingles not only
blushed, but she wiggled. With a glove twisted
in her hand, she had hesitated so long over the
answer to a question involving a disagreeable answer
that the most dramatic of all situations had
been produced.</p>

<p>The court would wait, the audience would hang
breathless, the attorneys, standing up, would lean
forward, while the witness tried to find words in
which to formulate a reply.</p>

<p>Then in three words the story would be told.
The jury would lean back and gasp. The judge
would swing around in his pivot chair and assume
an air of unconcern. The attorneys would busy
themselves with papers and the audience would
groan. Still Miss Gingles would sit there in the
witness chair unperturbed.</p>

<p>Could an innocent young woman sustain the
horror of such a climax?</p>

<p>The jury that rendered the verdict of "not
guilty" was a representative one. They ranged
from men high in the financial world to those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
low estate. In the days that they sat listening
to the terrible tale as unfolded by the little Irish
lace-maker and the physicians they appeared to
be held as though spellbound.</p>

<p>It was a dramatic trial, filled throughout with
thrills and shudders.</p>

<p>Sensation followed sensation. At no time during
the long trial, which cost the state of Illinois
nearly $100,000, did the interest lapse.</p>

<p>It was for the jurors to decide the truth of this
complication of alleged happenings and as to the
guilt of the little foreigner, charged by her alleged
persecutor with theft.</p>

<p>The important points on which Madame Barrett
based her charges against Ella Gingles
were:</p>

<p>That Ella Gingles signed a confession December
6, 1908, admitting she was a department
store thief.</p>

<p>That she stole valuable lace from her and used
the lace in the new dress.</p>

<p>That the lace-maker's injuries were self-inflicted.</p>

<p>Combatting this, the little defendant and her
stanch friends swore:</p>

<p>That she was a victim of a conspiracy on the
part of her accusers.</p>

<p>That her enemies attempted to make her a
white slave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>That she was urged by Madame Barrett to
accept money offered her by her tempter.</p>

<p>That she was seized, bound and horribly mistreated
in the Wellington hotel, as the result of
her refusal to accede to Madame Barrett's demands.</p>

<p>That the Barrett woman forced open, or caused
to be forced open, her trunk and took therefrom
laces and valuable keepsakes and personal properties
belonging to her.</p>

<p>It was charge met by charge.</p>

<p>During the long hearing Madame Barrett sat
alone. She seemed to have been shunned. At
no time did she lose her self-control. The most
violent charges seemed to affect her but little.</p>

<p>The girl would make some terrible charge from
the witness stand. The prosecuting witness
would sit immovable. Her face did not blanch.
It did not color to a crimson red. Her eyes did
not wander. Forever they were gazing directly
in front of her, yet without looking at any one
and anything.</p>

<p>It was the gaze and composure of a woman of
the world&mdash;a woman who has passed through horrors
before and who has become immune.</p>

<p>After the jury had been selected Miss Gingles
was released on bond. Previous to this time she
had been confined in the county jail at her own
request, as she charged her enemies were still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
following her and she feared they would do her
injury.</p>

<p>At the opening of the first session of court
First Assistant State's Attorney Benedict J.
Short made a short address.</p>

<p>"Miss Gingles, and not Miss Barrett, is on
trial here. You must try this case on the evidence
alone," said Mr. Short.</p>

<p>Attorney O'Donnell declared he would show
that Miss Gingles was the victim of a plot instigated
by an alleged agent representing an influential
Indiana Democratic politician.</p>

<p>Here are a few samples of questions asked veniremen
by Attorney O'Donnell of the defense:</p>

<p>"Are you married?"</p>

<p>"Have you any sisters?"</p>

<p>"Have you read about this case?"</p>

<p>"Miss Gingles is Irish&mdash;does that make any
difference?"</p>

<p>"Would it make any difference if Miss Gingles
belongs to a different religion than you do?"</p>

<p>Assistant State's Attorneys Short and Furthman
questioned prospective jurors along these
lines:</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about the Irish lace
store?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever stop at the Wellington hotel?"</p>

<p>"Can the state accept you as a juror with confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
that you will do your full duty and not be
swayed by outside influences?"</p>

<p>When Attorney Patrick H. O'Donnell, her
counsel, entered the courtroom he held a short
conference with Assistant State's Attorney
Short.</p>

<p>While they were talking Miss Gingles entered
the courtroom, accompanied by a deputy sheriff.</p>

<p>"We desire to have Miss Gingles admitted to
bail," said Mr. O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"I am very willing, I always have been willing
that Miss Gingles should be free on bail," replied
Mr. Short.</p>

<p>There was another short conference, after
which Mr. Short said: "We will accept you as
Miss Gingles' surety."</p>

<p>Thereupon Miss Gingles tripped lightly up to
the clerk's desk and wrote her name on the bond.
Mr. O'Donnell also affixed his signature to the
$2,000 bond and the pretty defendant was freed
from the attentions of the officer.</p>

<p>Ella Gingles presented a picture of fresh, girlish
beauty as she took her place in front of the
jury box.</p>

<p>She wore a white linen suit, with a long coat.
The collar and cuffs were trimmed with blue ribbon.
A tan straw hat, tam o'shanter style, was
patched by brown ribbons and roses. Her brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
hair, in curly puffs and waves, fell below her ears
and tumbled bewitchingly over her eyes.</p>

<p>The scene in the courtroom at the criminal
court when Ella Gingles took the witness stand
to relate her terrible story was one never to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>As the little lace-maker's name was called and
she rose to walk past the jury to the witness stand
fifty women seated in the back part of the courtroom
rose and began to clap their hands. Some
threw their handkerchiefs into the air.</p>

<p>The girl seemed much affected by the demonstration.
Judge Brentano seemed taken aback
for a moment by this unusual outburst. In vain
the bailiff pounded with his gavel for order.
Finally the court was compelled to rise and sternly
rebuke the courtroom in no uncertain terms.</p>

<p>Miss Gingles began her story in a low tone.
It was the voice of a schoolgirl telling of something
she had undergone, but could not comprehend.
The persons in the courtroom hung on
every word. You could have heard a pin fall.
As Miss Gingles took the stand Attorney O'Donnell
said:</p>

<p>"State your name."</p>

<p>"Ella Gingles," the witness replied, in a voice
that rang out through the courtroom. She said
she would be nineteen years old next November.
She was born in Ireland. Her father's name is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Thomas, and she has seven sisters and several
brothers. She said she came to America in November,
1907.</p>

<p>"Did you make Irish lace?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She identified a design shown her as one she
made when eight years old.</p>

<p>"Who made the hat you are now wearing?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>The hat was a peach-basket affair. A design
of lace was shown her and she said she was the
maker, as well as the designer.</p>

<p>She testified she won prizes in Ireland for fancy
lace-making. She said she originated several
designs.</p>

<p>Miss Gingles said she remained in Montreal
two days, later going to Belleville, Ontario, where
she worked as a cook. From there she went to
Toronto. She visited a sister in Michigan, coming
direct from there to Chicago about November
15, 1908.</p>

<p>"What did you do here?"</p>

<p>"I went to work as a chambermaid at the Wellington
hotel. I stayed there a week."</p>

<p>"What did you next do?"</p>

<p>"I went there to meet some fine lady to sell
laces to, and quit the work and sold them."</p>

<p>"Where did you next work?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"At a Michigan avenue restaurant, but quit
after four days."</p>

<p>"When and how did you meet Agnes Barrett?"</p>

<p>"I went to her store and showed her my lace."</p>

<p>At the mention of her name Miss Barrett
looked straight into the eyes of the girl she accused,
and Miss Gingles returned the glances
without coloring.</p>

<p>"Miss Barrett gave me some roses to work on,"
resumed the witness. "She gave me $1 and then
I made some berries and more roses."</p>

<p>Miss Gingles said she continued to work for
Miss Barrett, receiving $1 per day. Altogether
she worked four days for Miss Barrett before
Christmas.</p>

<p>"Did Miss Barrett say in your presence and a
maid that she missed things?"</p>

<p>"She said she missed some powder and paint
and some Limerick laces."</p>

<p>Miss Gingles seemed confident, and began to
smile as she testified. On January 4, she said,
she returned home at seven o'clock, and found
Miss Barrett and Mrs. Kenyon in her room.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Kenyon living or dead?"</p>

<p>"Dead."</p>

<p>Attorney O'Donnell dropped this line of questioning
and inquired further as to what occurred
on that evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>She said Miss Barrett and Mrs. Kenyon took
practically everything of value from her trunk,
including prize lace designs, underwear, photographs,
bracelets, strips of chiffon and a ring.</p>

<p>"Was the ring valuable?"</p>

<p>"It cost 15 cents in Ireland, but Miss Barrett
said: 'It must be valuable or it wouldn't be in a
costly box.'</p>

<p>"Besides, they trampled my clothes in the dirt
and greased what they left with candles."</p>

<p>"What else did they take?"</p>

<p>"A fancy pillow case I made on a ship."</p>

<p>The most startling part of the girl's story was
of the alleged attack upon her in the Wellington
hotel, although her testimony was the story of her
life practically from the time she came to America
from Ireland.</p>

<p>Miss Gingles, in her testimony, declared that
it was she, and not Miss Barrett, that had been
robbed, and she told a story of how her room at
474 La Salle avenue had been broken into and
ransacked in her absence and many valuable
pieces of lace taken.</p>

<p>She declared that the robbery was made complete
by Miss Barrett the same night in the Wellington
hotel by taking all the money out of her
purse and forcing her to walk back to her boarding
house from downtown in the cold of a winter's
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>She said that on this night she was forced to
sign a confession, admitting the theft of lace for
which the girl now is being tried.</p>

<p>Her story of the attack upon her in the Wellington
was the most remarkable ever heard in
the criminal court building, and during it there
were many outbursts from the spectators.</p>

<p>Miss Barrett, her accuser in the theft charge,
was as agitated as the witness, and several times
seemed on the verge of breaking down.</p>

<p>Attorney Patrick H. O'Donnell made good his
declaration that the story of Miss Gingles concerning
her treatment in the Wellington hotel
would be told under oath from the witness chair.</p>

<p>Step by step the lawyer led the girl.</p>

<p>"She offered me money; advised me to take the
money the man offered me whom she had brought
to the room when I was helpless. She choked me,
threatened me, and finally accused me of stealing
and made me sign a confession before she would
permit me to leave the room."</p>

<p>These were some of the accusations sobbed out
by the lace-maker.</p>

<p>Time and again there were seeming admissions
forced from the girl's lips which Mr. Short hoped
would lay the foundation for impeachment of the
most sensational sort.</p>

<p>There was a short delay, owing to a number of
emergency matters set before Judge Brentano.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Then Mr. O'Donnell resumed the questioning of
Miss Gingles as follows:</p>

<p>"In Captain O'Brien's office when this necklace
was produced, what did you say?"</p>

<p>"I said it was my necklace," answered the witness.</p>

<p>"Did Captain O'Brien say anything about you
proving that it was your necklace?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I told him that Daisy Young of Belleville,
Ontario, could prove that the necklace was
mine," answered Miss Gingles.</p>

<p>"Did you write to Daisy Young?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did she answer your letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you show the letter to Captain O'Brien?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have you the letter Daisy Young wrote?"</p>

<p>"Yes; here it is."</p>

<p>"Now, I'll read it," said Mr. O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"No, you won't; I object," said Assistant Prosecutor
Short.</p>

<p>"Sustained," said Judge Brentano.</p>

<p>"But I want to show that Captain O'Brien's
suppressed evidence is contradicted by this letter,"
returned Mr. O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"There is no rule of evidence whereby such a
letter could be admissible," replied the court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you meet Mary Brennan at the door of
Miss Barrett's room as she testified?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Now, tell the jury if there was any property
in your room that didn't belong to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a towel from the Wellington hotel."</p>

<p>"Did you tell Captain O'Brien?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"When you went to Miss Barrett's room what
happened?" asked Attorney O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"Miss Barrett and Mrs. Kenyon went with me,
and Mrs. Kenyon whispered something into my
ear. Then Mrs. Kenyon told me I had to take
off my clothes. I told her I would do nothing of
the sort. Then Miss Barrett and Mrs. Kenyon
took off my clothes and made me go to bed. Then
Miss Barrett told me that she wanted me to go to
French Lick Springs, Indiana."</p>

<p>"Did she tell you what she wanted you to go
there for?" asked Mr. O'Donnell.</p>

<p>Here Miss Gingles began to cry.</p>

<p>"Don't do that, Ella," said Mr. O'Donnell.</p>

<p>The girl made revolting charges against both
Agnes Barrett and Mrs. Kenyon.</p>

<p>"What happened then?" was asked.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Barrett offered me a silk dress if
I would do as she told me."</p>

<p>"Did she show you the dress?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell what happened," urged the attorney.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Kenyon said to Miss Barrett: 'Where
is the other girl? We promised them to bring
two girls here.'"</p>

<p>"Did any men enter the room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, one man came in."</p>

<p>"What else happened?"</p>

<p>"Miss Barrett and Mrs. Kenyon held me."</p>

<p>"Did the man offer you any money?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I wouldn't take it."</p>

<p>"Did Miss Barrett tell you to take it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Was the light burning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but when the man came in Miss Barrett
turned it off."</p>

<p>"Did you know at the time that Miss Barrett
had gone to your room and taken the lace and
other articles that you are now charged with
stealing?" asked Mr. O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Did Miss Barrett say anything to you that
night about losing lace?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and she said I had stolen it. I told her
it was a lie."</p>

<p>"What did Miss Barrett say?"</p>

<p>"She had a paper and said I would have to sign
it and admit that I had stolen the lace. I refused
to do it."</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"She said if I didn't sign it she would call that
man back again. Then I signed it."</p>

<p>"Did you call Miss Barrett any names that
night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I told her that she was a beast and that
Mrs. Kenyon was another."</p>

<p>"Tell the jury what you did."</p>

<p>"I tried to scream, but Miss Barrett put a
towel over my mouth and she said if I screamed
again she would choke me."</p>

<p>The girl declared that Mrs. Kenyon and Miss
Barrett had prevented her resisting the man.</p>

<p>She declared she had cried and when she went
home she asked two women to call a policeman.
"They told me to go to Captain O'Brien's office
the next day and I did," said Miss Gingles.</p>

<p>"Did you have any money?" was asked.</p>

<p>"No, Miss Barrett took all my money out of
my purse."</p>

<p>"How did you get home to 474 La Salle avenue?"</p>

<p>"I ran home."</p>

<p>"That's all," said Attorney O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"Did you run all the way home?" was the first
question by Prosecutor Short on cross-examination.</p>

<p>"Yes, ran or walked."</p>

<p>"Which way did you go?"</p>

<p>"I ran out in Jackson boulevard and ran west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
on the north side of the street," answered Miss
Gingles.</p>

<p>"Did you see any people while you were running?</p>

<p>"I didn't notice many."</p>

<p>"How did you go down stairs?"</p>

<p>"I took the elevator."</p>

<p>"Didn't you know there was a policeman in
the Wellington hotel?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't see any policeman."</p>

<p>"There were lots of people in the hotel office,
wasn't there?"</p>

<p>"I didn't stop to notice."</p>

<p>"You didn't have any money to pay your car
fare?"</p>

<p>"No; Miss Barrett had taken all my money."</p>

<p>"You saw people in the streets, but you didn't
stop and tell any of them to call a policeman?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What time did you leave the Wellington hotel?"</p>

<p>"At twenty-five minutes to twelve o'clock."</p>

<p>"How long did it take you to get home?"</p>

<p>"About twenty minutes."</p>

<p>"What was the first thing you did when you
got home?"</p>

<p>"I saw Mrs. Linderman, the landlady."</p>

<p>"Where was she?"</p>

<p>"In the basement."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"What was the first thing you said to Mrs.
Linderman?"</p>

<p>"I told her that an awful thing had happened.
Then I told her all."</p>

<p>"What did you do then?"</p>

<p>"I asked her how I could get a policeman, and
she said it was too late and to wait till the next
day. Then I went upstairs to see another woman
and told her the same thing, and she said I
had better wait and go to see Captain O'Brien
the next day."</p>

<p>"Then what happened?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Linderman went with me to my room,
and there I found that my trunk had been broken
into and most of my things taken. I showed
Mrs. Linderman what had been done."</p>

<p>"That was when Miss Barrett had gone to
your room and taken the lace and other things
which she claimed you had stolen?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You went to see Captain O'Brien the next
day, did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you tell him that you had been attacked?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You didn't mention anything, not to a man
anyway, about what you have related as occurring
in Miss Barrett's room?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just told them you had been robbed of $100
worth of lace?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you tell anybody&mdash;any of the policemen
who went around with you, about it?"</p>

<p>"No, I couldn't tell that awful story to anybody."</p>

<p>"This confession you signed to Miss Barrett
wasn't the first confession you ever signed, was
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"I'm positive."</p>

<p>Here Prosecutor Short produced the first sensational
attack upon Ella Gingles.</p>

<p>"Didn't you sign a confession that you had
taken goods from a department store?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How old do you say you are?"</p>

<p>"I am eighteen."</p>

<p>"Look at this signature signed December 6,
1908&mdash;is that your signature?"</p>

<p>Here Mr. Short produced a paper purporting
to be a confession that Ella Gingles had made,
when accused of theft in a department store.</p>

<p>"That is my signature," said Miss Gingles.</p>

<p>Her voice quivered. There was a gasp among
the women who had flocked to the courtroom to
lend their moral aid to the accused girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's see," said Mr. Short, mercilessly. "At
the very outset this paper says&mdash;your admission&mdash;that
you were then twenty years old."</p>

<p>"No, sir," interrupted Miss Gingles.</p>

<p>"Here, look at it; there it is, twenty years old."</p>

<p>"I told them I was eighteen."</p>

<p>"You have said you were born in Ireland?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But this document says&mdash;your admission&mdash;that
you were born in London."</p>

<p>The witness made no answer.</p>

<p>Mr. Short attempted to offer the document in
evidence, but was temporarily prevented by a
ruling of the court.</p>

<p>"You say you were a good girl&mdash;a perfectly
good girl&mdash;up to the time you met Agnes Barrett?"</p>

<p>"Yes; oh, yes, sir," sobbed Miss Gingles.</p>

<p>"You lived in Belleville, Ontario, before coming
to Chicago?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"As Ella Gingles?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What! Didn't you call yourself Ella Raymond?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Did you know a Dr. Gibson there?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Didn't he attend you when you were ill?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"He did not; he did not."</p>

<p>Mr. Short intimated that this part of the girl's
testimony would be impeached by testimony of
the physician.</p>

<p>"It was under the auspices of that woman's
guild at Belleville, Ontario, that you went to
work for Mrs. Thornton?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"No white slave about that?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Was that Mrs. D. S. Thornton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You never had any trouble with them?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"When were you taken ill?"</p>

<p>"About two months later."</p>

<p>"What was the doctor's name?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember."</p>

<p>"How long were you at the hospital?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember."</p>

<p>"Didn't the nurse and Mrs. Thornton object to
having you go back to work?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>On this point the witness was quite positive.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Short described the Thornton house
and asked the witness if she didn't know that up
in the attic much linen was stored.</p>

<p>Miss Gingles said that she didn't know about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
it. She described the marking on the linen, and
then was asked:</p>

<p>"If Mr. Thornton said you took linen from his
house, he is wrong?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Would you know his handwriting?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Short showed her the letter from
Mr. Thornton that Captain O'Brien had.</p>

<p>"That is his handwriting, but the letter is not
true," said the witness.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Short returned to the baby clothes
that were found in Miss Gingles' trunk.</p>

<p>"How long have you had these baby clothes?"</p>

<p>"About four months."</p>

<p>"How much larger were you going to make
these clothes?"</p>

<p>"Just a little larger."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you start at these?"</p>

<p>"I was waiting for a job."</p>

<p>"You had lots of time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I had to work at lace-making to support
myself."</p>

<p>"When you were at the Thornton house didn't
the family go away?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to Quebec."</p>

<p>"And didn't you have a photograph taken in
one of Mrs. Thornton's lace dresses?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Mr. Short showed her a picture of herself
taken by R. McCormick of Belleville.</p>

<p>"That is an enlargement of a photograph that
I had taken in Ireland," said Miss Gingles.</p>

<p>"You didn't have this taken in Belleville?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"When you went back to the Thornton home
from the hospital did the doctor go back with
you, or did you ask him to speak to them?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Where did you come from to Chicago after
leaving the Thorntons?"</p>

<p>"I went to work for Mrs. Lindquist in July
and went to Toronto with her, and then went to
Bangor, Michigan, and then to Chicago."</p>

<p>"Where did you go when you went to Chicago?"</p>

<p>"To Mrs. Linderman's house."</p>

<p>"Didn't you have a room at 300 Indiana
street?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I roomed with Mrs. Rice."</p>

<p>"No trouble there, did you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Where did she work?"</p>

<p>"In the Wellington hotel."</p>

<p>"What did she do?"</p>

<p>"She was the linen girl."</p>

<p>"How far is 300 Indiana street from 474 La
Salle avenue?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Half a dozen blocks."</p>

<p>"You went into Miss Barrett's lace store for
the first time in November?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Was that before you went to work in the
Wellington?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you see Miss Barrett?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you know Mrs. Kenyon's sister?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you have any conversation with anybody
there about your mother in Ireland?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Did you tell Miss Barrett that your mother
had given you 200 to come to the country for a
good time and that you had lost it on the way
to the boat?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you tell Miss Barrett that you lived at
the Wellington hotel?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Then, prompted by Miss Barrett, Mr. Short
put the witness through a long questioning regarding
the different kinds of lace.</p>

<p>It was a duel of lace-making knowledge between
Miss Gingles and Agnes Barrett, but Mr.
Short failed to secure any important admissions.</p>

<p>A queer incident occurred after the adjournment.
Ella Gingles, who was formerly kept a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
prisoner in the county jail, and who was released
on bail, ran from the witness stand into the arms
of several women who are befriending her. Agnes
Barrett, white and desperate at the charges made
against her, ran back from the advancing throng
of women.</p>

<p>The accuser of Ella Gingles ran past the jury
out of the room by the prisoners' door&mdash;the door
used by Ella Gingles to enter and leave the room
under the escort of a negro deputy sheriff.</p>

<p>Miss Barrett hurried down the stairs and into
the office of Mr. Short.</p>

<p>Among the women who were with the lace-maker
were Mrs. T. G. Kent, president of the
Daughters of the Confederacy; Mrs. Van Dusen
Cooke of the Socialist Women of the United
States; Mrs. M. C. Brem of the Social Economics
Club; Mrs. Lyman Cooley of the Evanston
W. C. T. U.; Mrs. Mollie Benecke, Irish Choral
Society; Dr. M. V. Maxson; Mrs. Margaret Inglehart;
Mrs. Frances Hagen, and Mrs. Frances
Howe, Children's Day Association.</p>

<p>Testimony which was deemed favorable to
Miss Gingles was given by Captain P. D.
O'Brien of the detective bureau, who was called
by the state. Captain O'Brien admitted that he
had formerly been friendly to Miss Gingles, and
Attorney O'Donnell got it before the jury that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
he had even suggested the employment of her
present counsel.</p>

<p>The detective chief gave testimony which was
thought to favor the defendant. The witness declared
that the first charge of theft was made by
Ella Gingles against Agnes Barrett of the Wellington
hotel, and told of an investigation by the
police of a raid on Miss Gingles' home, 474 La
Salle avenue, in which Miss Barrett and Mrs.
Kenyon took away some lace and a watch and
bank book belonging to the defendant.</p>

<p>His examination, conducted by Mr. Short, follows:</p>

<p>"Do you remember seeing Miss Barrett and
Ella Gingles on January 5, 1909?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Ella Gingles came to my office and said
she worked at the Wellington hotel and that Mrs.
Kenyon and Miss Barrett had gone to her room
at 474 La Salle avenue and took her watch, bank
book and laces, claiming she had stolen the lace.
She said they had compelled her to sign a statement
that she had stolen the lace.</p>

<p>"I asked Ella Gingles if she stole the lace and
she said, 'No.'</p>

<p>"I told her I thought it was funny that she
should have signed the statement.</p>

<p>"I sent for Miss Barrett and Mrs. Kenyon.
The latter came. We had the lace, watch and
bank book taken to my office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"What was the lace kept in?"</p>

<p>"A blue pillow case."</p>

<p>"Finally Miss Barrett came to my office and I
had her and Miss Gingles attempt to sort out the
laces which they claimed were theirs. Then we
put the lace on a table and Miss Barrett and Miss
Gingles both claimed most of the lace. I told
them they had better take the case to court. I
told Miss Gingles not to give Miss Barrett the
lace if it didn't belong to her."</p>

<p>"Miss Gingles did admit that some of the lace
belonged to Miss Barrett, did she?" asked Mr.
Short.</p>

<p>"Yes, but she claimed that Miss Barrett or
some of her friends took it to her room. She denied
having stolen it."</p>

<p>"What did Miss Barrett say about the watch
and bank book?"</p>

<p>"She said she had lost other property and that
she thought she could keep it until her loss had
been made good. I told her she couldn't do that
in my office."</p>

<p>"Was there any trouble over a necklace?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Miss Barrett claimed a necklace which
she said she had bought in New York. Miss
Gingles denied the assertion and said she had
brought the necklace from Ireland."</p>

<p>The necklace was introduced in evidence.</p>

<p>Attorney O'Donnell began the cross-examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
in an unusual manner, which called for an
equally unusual objection from Prosecutor Short.</p>

<p>"Good morning, captain," Mr. O'Donnell began,
in his most dulcet, honeyed tones.</p>

<p>"Good morning," returned the witness.</p>

<p>"I object," shouted Mr. Short.</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Judge Brentano, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care about Mr. O'Donnell's good
morning, but to its obvious purpose," said Mr.
Short.</p>

<p>After some preliminary questions Mr. O'Donnell
asked Captain O'Brien if he remembered a
statement made to him in the presence of Chief
Clerk William Luthardt of the police department,
to the effect that when the piles of lace
were divided "Ella Gingles had the pile and Agnes
Barrett had the scraps."</p>

<p>Captain O'Brien said he didn't remember it
that way.</p>

<p>"But the piles were about equally divided,"
said Captain O'Brien.</p>

<p>The witness' memory failed him on several
points which had impressed Mr. O'Donnell, and
finally, when the lawyer became nettled, he
snapped this question across the table:</p>

<p>"You were the first person to suggest that I
defend Miss Gingles&mdash;you wanted me to defend
her, didn't you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Objection by Mr. Short was promptly sustained.</p>

<p>E. C. Capon, manager of the Wellington hotel,
then was called and asked to identify a pass-key
which the state claims was found in the Gingles
girl's room.</p>

<p>"That's a maid's pass-key," said Capon.</p>

<p>"Poof! I never had a pass-key&mdash;I never saw
that one until I was arrested," said Miss Gingles.</p>

<p>May Brennan, who came direct to Chicago
from County Sligo, Ireland, less than a year ago,
was the next witness.</p>

<p>"What is your occupation?" asked Mr. Short.</p>

<p>"I'm a lace teacher."</p>

<p>"Did you try to get Miss Gingles a position
in a department store?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did any one ask you to befriend Miss Gingles?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Miss Barrett."</p>

<p>Then Prosecutor Short sprang his big surprise.</p>

<p>"Here is a piece of lace taken from Miss Gingles'
room. Did you ever see that before?" asked
Mr. Short.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I made it. That's my own make."</p>

<p>"What did you do with the original piece of
lace?"</p>

<p>"I sent it to Miss Barrett at French Lick, Indiana,
last summer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know how Ella Gingles came to have
this lace?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You didn't give it to her?"</p>

<p>"No. I gave it to Miss Barrett."</p>

<p>Witness then told of having seen Ella Gingles
go to Miss Barrett's room in the Wellington hotel
early last January.</p>

<p>"Miss Barrett sent me up to her room and I
saw Miss Gingles waiting for somebody. Then
a bellboy gave Ella Gingles Miss Barrett's pass-key
and we both went into the room."</p>

<p>Witness did not know how Miss Gingles came
to demand the pass-key of Miss Barrett's room,
but was sure she went into the room when Miss
Barrett was absent.</p>

<p>Miss Margaret Donahue was then called. She
is secretary of the Wellington Hotel Company.</p>

<p>"Was any of your property found in Miss Gingles'
room?" asked Mr. Short.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is this the property you refer to?" and Mr.
Short waved before the jury a pair of long, black,
silk stockings.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;those are mine."</p>

<p>Mr. O'Donnell looked at Miss Gingles&mdash;the
latter turned pink and the jury gingerly examined
the expansive hosiery that was passed over
the railing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>The strongest part of Mrs. Linderman's testimony
came when she told of having gone to the
Wellington hotel February 17, the morning after
the bathroom episode. She found Miss Gingles
delirious, in bed under the care of a physician.
Attorney Patrick H. O'Donnell and several policemen
were there, the witness declared.</p>

<p>"Tell the condition of Ella Gingles," commanded
Attorney O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"She was crazy, crazy, crazy," declared Mrs.
Linderman.</p>

<p>"What did she do?"</p>

<p>"She lay on the bed and screamed at the top
of her voice."</p>

<p>"What did she scream?"</p>

<p>"She kept repeating, 'Oh, Miss Barrett! Don't
let that devil-man in here again! Don't let him
kill me, Miss Barrett! Save me, Miss Barrett.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Linderman also told of how Ella Gingles,
on the night of January 4, following the first alleged
attack in the room of Miss Barrett at the
Wellington hotel, had come home in a disheveled,
hysterical condition.</p>

<p>"She told me that a terrible thing had happened
to her and accused Miss Barrett. But she
was afraid to tell me because she said that Miss
Barrett had threatened to kill her if she told,"
said Mrs. Linderman.</p>

<p>Just before Mrs. Linderman, the mother, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the stand Tecla, her thirteen-year-old daughter,
preceded her. She swore positively that the
necklace which Miss Agnes Barrett accuses Ella
Gingles of stealing was a substitute.</p>

<p>She wore a school girl's dress of white muslin,
with an over-yoke of lace. Her hair was combed
back from her forehead and tied at the back with
a white silk ribbon.</p>

<p>The little girl was somewhat confused and held
up her wrong hand when taking the oath. Her
testimony follows:</p>

<p>"Do you know Ella Gingles?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Did she ever live at your house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen her wearing jewelry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I saw her wearing a necklace of purple
beads."</p>

<p>"How long after she came to your house did
you see her wearing them?"</p>

<p>"I can't remember exactly."</p>

<p>"Where was it you saw her wearing the
beads?"</p>

<p>"She was in the kitchen."</p>

<p>"You are sure you saw her wearing the beads?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I remember it plainly."</p>

<p>"Was your mother in the kitchen at the time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Did she see Ella wearing the necklace?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Short, the youthful
witness was trapped as to the number of beads in
the necklace held by the attorney.</p>

<p>"How many beads were there on Ella's necklace?"
asked Mr. Stout.</p>

<p>"There were seven."</p>

<p>The prosecuting attorney produced the necklace
alleged to have been stolen by Miss Gingles
from Miss Barrett.</p>

<p>"Is this the necklace Ella wore?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I say, no, sir. It is a different necklace."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"This has five beads and Ella's had seven."</p>

<p>Mrs. Linderman, mother of Tecla Linderman,
then took the stand. Her testimony was sensational.
She related the story of the night when
Miss Barrett and Miss Donahue visited the Linderman
home in La Salle avenue and ransacked
the room of the little lace-maker.</p>

<p>Then she went into the details of the condition
of Miss Gingles after the happenings at the Wellington
hotel. She declared that the girl was a
raving maniac when she went to the hotel on the
afternoon Miss Gingles was found bound hand
and foot, with large gashes cut in her body, in
the bathroom of the hostelry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were at home on the night Miss Barrett
and the other woman called to see Miss Gingles
at the La Salle avenue home?" suggested Attorney
O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered the witness.</p>

<p>"How long were the women with Ella Gingles&mdash;to
the best of your knowledge?" asked Mr.
O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"At least two hours."</p>

<p>"Did Ella Gingles go away with the women?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What time did she return?"</p>

<p>"About twelve o'clock."</p>

<p>"What was her condition?"</p>

<p>"She was crying terribly. Her eyes were red
and her hair was all tumbled down. She said she
had been treated horribly. She said she couldn't
tell me what was the matter, because they would
kill her if she told any one."</p>

<p>"What else happened?"</p>

<p>"We went to her room together and I saw that
her clothes had been dumped into a heap and
were covered with candle grease. I helped her
to clean them."</p>

<p>"Ella Gingles didn't tell you what they did to
her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Wasn't your curiosity excited?" asked Judge
Brentano.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but what could I do? It was midnight."</p>

<p>Mr. Short then asked the witness how she came
to go to the Wellington hotel February 17, following
the alleged attack in the bathroom.</p>

<p>"Mr. O'Donnell came to my house with a man
in an automobile, and told me Ella Gingles was
being murdered in the Wellington hotel," replied
Mrs. Linderman.</p>

<p>Then came some testimony calculated to embarrass
Attorney O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"You went direct to Ella Gingles' room, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"She was in bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And Mr. O'Donnell was sitting near the
bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And Mr. O'Donnell had his arms around
Miss Gingles?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And Ella Gingles had her arms around Mr.
O'Donnell?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Who went with you to the room?"</p>

<p>"Miss Joyce."</p>

<p>"Oh, you didn't go direct to the Wellington
hotel from your home to the Wellington when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
you heard that Ella Gingles was being murdered?"</p>

<p>"No. I went first to Mr. O'Donnell's office."</p>

<p>"You say Ella Gingles was a raving maniac?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She acted as if she were under the influence
of some dope."</p>

<p>"Dope? Where did you hear that word?"</p>

<p>"I read it in the medical books," was the surprising
answer.</p>

<p>"Did Ella Gingles talk to Mr. O'Donnell?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What did she call him?"</p>

<p>"Mr. O'Donnell."</p>

<p>"Did she call him by his first name?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"How long were you in this room?"</p>

<p>"An hour, at least."</p>

<p>"Nobody suggested that she be sent to a hospital?"</p>

<p>"Did a physician come?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What did he do?"</p>

<p>"Ordered us all to leave the room."</p>

<p>"Did all go out?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Do you remember handling the cords with
which Ella Gingles was tied?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did you know she had been tied and that
those were the cords?"</p>

<p>"A policeman told me."</p>

<p>"Were there any books in Miss Gingles'
trunk?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I saw several books."</p>

<p>"Don't you know that Ella Gingles claims she
never read but one book in her life, and that one
of Dickens' novels?"</p>

<p>"No; I don't know anything about that."</p>

<p>"Did you know that Miss Gingles was starving
between January 4 and February 16?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I heard she was hungry."</p>

<p>"Did you give her anything to eat?"</p>

<p>"Yes; several times I gave her coffee and toast.
I knew she had no money."</p>

<p>"You would have given her money if you knew
she were starving in your home?"</p>

<p>"I had no money, but I didn't take her room
money."</p>

<p>A sharp clash took place between Attorney
O'Donnell and Judge Brentano when the lawyer
objected to one of Prosecutor Short's rapid-fire
questions.</p>

<p>"I'll rule it out if you are invoking the strict
rules of evidence, but it is pretty late to invoke
them now," said Judge Brentano.</p>

<p>"I'll invoke the rule and take exception to the
court's remark," answered the attorney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Save your exception," retorted Judge Brentano.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mr. O'Donnell began
questioning Mrs. Linderman regarding the letter
which was received by Miss Joyce and telling
of her alleged tortures which resulted in her being
found bound and gagged in a Wellington
hotel bathroom.</p>

<p>"I object! This isn't proper. I'm invoking
the strict rules now," said Mr. Short.</p>

<p>"Sustained," said Judge Brentano.</p>

<p>"Give me the letter, then," snapped Mr.
O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"Say please," replied Mr. Short, holding the
letter teasingly.</p>

<p>"Please. Being attorney for the Chinese, I'll
'kow-tow' to you," said Mr. O'Donnell, solemnly
making the Chinese salutation to royalty.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mr. Short objected again.</p>

<p>"That's only a self-serving declaration," he declared.</p>

<p>"Who does it serve?" sarcastically inquired Mr.
O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"It serves you," was the prosecutor's quick retort.</p>

<p>"Oh, indict me, why don't you?" rejoined Mr.
O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"I will if I get anything on you."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you probably will whether you get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
anything on me or not," said Mr. O'Donnell, angrily.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;oh, no, I won't," and Mr. Short corrected
himself quickly.</p>

<p>Belle Carson, 32 Goethe street, was then
called and swore that Ella Gingles had gone to
her room on the night of January 4 and that the
girl had asked her about getting a policeman.</p>

<p>"I told her the names of two judges I knew."</p>

<p>Miss Carson told how Ella Gingles had
brought some lace to her room and told her how
Irish lace was made. Miss Carson at that time
had a room at 474 La Salle avenue.</p>

<p>"I went to Miss Gingles' room and saw the
laces which she was making."</p>

<p>"Were they large or small?"</p>

<p>"Small."</p>

<p>Tom Taggart, the Indiana politician, and former
Democratic national committeeman, appeared
as a voluntary witness to clear his name
of charges made in the defense of Ella Gingles.</p>

<p>Mr. Taggart was treated with the utmost deference.
Other witnesses may have been "ragged"
by counsel for both sides, but Taggart was immune
from even being asked to repeat his testimony
or to give any explanations.</p>

<p>Mr. Taggart told a straightforward story and
it consisted mainly in denying that he knew Ella
Gingles or that he had ever known Agnes Barrett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
except in a business way through her lace
business at French Lick Springs, Indiana.</p>

<p>The rest of his testimony was given over to
proving that he is an utterly unsophisticated Indianian,
and when asked about the alleged "white
slave" traffic he innocently asked:</p>

<p>"What is a 'white slave'?"</p>

<p>Mr. Short gave the definition, without even
cracking a smile.</p>

<p>When Mr. Taggart had been enlightened he
declared that there were no "white slaves" in his
hotel in French Lick.</p>

<p>"We don't let any bad characters stay in the
hotel if we know them. My hotel is perfectly respectable;
it is patronized by the best people in
the United States, from Maine to California,"
he declared.</p>

<p>Mr. O'Donnell was equally careful not to
ruffle the temper or feelings of the witness. He
asked a few perfunctory questions and said,
"That is all, Mr. Taggart."</p>

<p>Mr. Taggart, however, wanted to talk some
more. Turning to the court, he said:</p>

<p>"Your Honor, I came here as a voluntary witness."</p>

<p>"Of course you did," put in Mr. Short.</p>

<p>"And I wanted to vindicate my name. There
was so much said in the papers when Miss Gingles
made her statement&mdash;I just wanted to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and put things right," was the gist of the explanation
volubly made by Mr. Taggart.</p>

<p>It developed that Mr. Taggart has kept two
detectives employed since the opening of the trial
to report to him the developments, especially as
they related to the use of his name in the testimony.</p>

<p>Dr. H. A. Watson, 4358 Lake avenue, and
house physician at the Wellington hotel, followed
Mr. Taggart on the witness stand.</p>

<p>"On February 17, were you called to attend
Ella Gingles?"</p>

<p>"I object!" shouted Attorney O'Shaughnessey.</p>

<p>"On what grounds?" asked Judge Brentano.</p>

<p>"It isn't relevant to the issue," replied Mr.
O'Shaughnessey.</p>

<p>"If this case had been tried on merely relevant
issues it would have been finished in twenty minutes,"
retorted the court.</p>

<p>"Did you go to the bathroom on the fifth floor
of the hotel?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What did you see?"</p>

<p>"The transom of the bathroom had been taken
out and the door opened from the inside. On
the floor lay a girl. One knee was tied and one
foot fastened to the foot of the bathtub. Both
hands were tied."</p>

<p>"Were they slip knots?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. Hard knots. The feet were tied with
cords and the knee with a stocking."</p>

<p>"What was her condition?"</p>

<p>"She was not unconscious. The pupils of the
eyes were widely dilated. I asked her who her
friends were and she asked me to send for Captain
O'Brien."</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>"She was crying, as hysterical people do. She
kept saying, 'They threw pepper in my eyes.'"</p>

<p>"'I can't drink any more wine.' She also said
she was a friend of Mr. O'Donnell."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"I examined to see if she had been attacked,
and found there were no such indications. I cut
her loose and found she wasn't in a bad way. Her
pulse was good and she did not need medicine."</p>

<p>"How about her wounds?"</p>

<p>"They were scratches, and not cuts."</p>

<p>"When we took her to a room she kept crying
and said, 'They cut me! They threw pepper in
my eyes and put me in a cab.'"</p>

<p>"We object to this form of questioning," said
Mr. Short.</p>

<p>"The objection is sustained. The court will
state why. You are asking questions, Mr. O'Donnell,
on matters that nobody can testify to unless
you take the stand yourself."</p>

<p>"Your honor," shouted the Irish lawyer, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
don't have to take the stand, sir. My good wife
will take it."</p>

<p>"Very good; then proceed," answered Judge
Brentano.</p>

<p>"Now, as a matter of fact, did you not see this
girl lying there on that bed in a semi-conscious
condition, so far from rational that I was compelled
to shake her to make her recognize me?"</p>

<p>"I saw you shake her. She did not appear to
me irrational apart from the hysteria."</p>

<p>"What position was Miss Gingles in when you
found her in the bathroom?" resumed Mr. Short,
again taking the witness.</p>

<p>"She was lying on her right side and her body
stretched from one end of the bathtub. Her feet
were tied to the iron pipe under the stationary
bowl. Her hands were tied to the iron foot at
the end of the tub."</p>

<p>"Did you know Miss Gingles before?"</p>

<p>"No. I never saw her before."</p>

<p>"Was there anything much the matter with her
aside from being hysterical? Did you see the
scratches on her arms and body?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Those scratches were very superficial.
They did not more than penetrate the first skin."</p>

<p>"Did you see a liquid in the bathroom?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I thought it was wine. Also there was
a little bottle of laudanum."</p>

<p>"Now, if this girl had taken laudanum, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
would have been the condition of the pupils of
her eyes?"</p>

<p>"They would have been very much contracted."</p>

<p>By Mr. O'Donnell: "And tell us, had she a
cut on the inside of the thigh, running crosswise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she had such a cut."</p>

<p>"There were many cuts, altogether?"</p>

<p>"I don't recall precisely how many."</p>

<p>Mr. O'Donnell dramatically seized Ella Gingles
by the hand, almost dragged her to the witness
chair, and then demanded explosively:</p>

<p>"Did you see this cut, and this one, and that
one and that one? Did you really see any cuts?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I saw several cuts, but I cannot say
that these are the scars from them."</p>

<p>"Now, how many cuts did you find?"</p>

<p>"As I remember it, there were several on the
arms and one on the leg."</p>

<p>"Which leg?"</p>

<p>"I do not recall."</p>

<p>"Did you see other bruises and injuries on the
girl's body?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember generally that she was cut
and scratched slightly, but I did not regard any
of the injuries as serious."</p>

<p>"Do you know that Ella Gingles had ten
wounds altogether?"</p>

<p>"All I recall I have told you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"How long were you in the bathroom with
Ella Gingles before you untied her?"</p>

<p>"Not more than a few minutes."</p>

<p>"Now, about this pink baby ribbon Mr. Short
is trying to make out Ella was tied with. Didn't
you see me take it out of her nightgown?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember."</p>

<p>"Well, I took it out of her neck-band because
she was tearing at herself, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't tell that."</p>

<p>"Did you see me take the gag off her?"</p>

<p>"It was hanging under her chin when I first
saw her, but I don't know who took it off."</p>

<p>"You remember a big crowd of newspaper
men being in the room, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Many people were there. I did not know
many of them."</p>

<p>"How does it come that you say you took Miss
Gingles out of the bathroom at eleven p. m. when
Captain O'Brien was called and told of her condition
at ten?"</p>

<p>"Well, I understood that you had been there
and gone before I reached there."</p>

<p>"Was one of her arms tied with a stocking?"
asked Mr. O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Had she her own stockings on?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I don't recall exactly. I don't think
she had them both on."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, were there not three
stockings? Did not Ella have her own stockings
on?"</p>

<p>"Well, I won't be positive about it."</p>

<p>"Was she brought to the bed in the same condition
you took her from the bathroom?"</p>

<p>"I believe she was."</p>

<p>"When you left you are sure she had on a
black skirt?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you are not sure whether she had on
stockings or not?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Between the time you cut Ella Gingles loose
and we got there were any clothes taken off or
put on Ella Gingles?"</p>

<p>"Not that I can remember."</p>

<p>Dr. Watson proved to have a bad memory. He
couldn't remember who took charge of the cords
that bound Ella Gingles or what was done and
said after the girl was found in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Professor Henry J. Cox of the United States
Weather Bureau was then called by the state.</p>

<p>"What kind of a night was January 4, 1909?"
asked Mr. Short.</p>

<p>"It was cloudy, and at eleven a. m. the temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
was fifty and at midnight it was forty-five."</p>

<p>"Did it rain that night?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"But there was a mist, wasn't there?" asked
Mr. O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"No such record."</p>

<p>"What kind of clouds were there?"</p>

<p>"Low, hanging clouds."</p>

<p>"When did the sky clear?"</p>

<p>"At four a. m."</p>

<p>"Let me look at that book," said Mr. O'Donnell.</p>

<p>"I'm not a&mdash;what do you call it&mdash;meterologist?"
suggested Mr. Cox.</p>

<p>"Read the meter, Pat," said Mr. Short.</p>

<p>"Here. What's this? Why, the record shows
there was rain that night!" shouted Mr. O'Donnell.</p>

<p>Mr. Cox looked and saw the letter "T" opposite
the temperature reading for nine p. m.</p>

<p>"That means 'trace.' Yes, there was a trace
of rain at that hour," admitted Mr. Cox.</p>

<p>When the case closed and the arguments were
through the courtroom was filled with wild, expectant
people. It was a scene never equaled in
Cook county. Even the scenes of confusion in
the trial of Dora McDonald for the slaying of
Webster Guerin were eclipsed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>The jury did not deliberate long. A few hours
sufficed to reach a verdict. There was some contention
on the part of one juror, but he was soon
convinced that the verdict should be not guilty.</p>

<p>The scene when the verdict was handed to
Judge Brentano was appalling.</p>

<p>The little Irish girl standing in front of the
bar of justice, with eyes looking straight ahead
into those of the judge; the auditors standing
breathless awaiting the words that were to fall
from his lips.</p>

<p>When the court read from the slip of paper,
"We, the jury, find Ella Gingles not guilty,"
bedlam broke loose. Men and women, many of
them richly dressed, rioted madly. Several of
the clubwomen and members of the Irish Fellowship
Society ran to the girl's side and hugged and
kissed her.</p>

<p>For several minutes the court made no attempt
to still the outbreak. He, too, grim and stern,
and used to tragedies in the court, seemed to feel
the joyfulness of the occasion.</p>

<p>"I'm so happy," the little lace-maker told her
friends. "I was certain I would be freed. It
was a horrible plot against me, but with all my
friends working for me I knew I could not come
to any harm."</p>

<p>After leaving the courtroom the girl was taken
in a cab to the home of a wealthy clubwoman on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the south side. That evening hundreds of supporters
called to greet her and tell her of their
joy at her acquittal. Several of them joined together
and presented her with a small diamond
brooch.</p>

<p>The next day the little lace-maker began making
arrangements to return to her old home and
to her parents, at Larne, Ireland. There with
her family she expected to try to live down the
horrors of her experiences in Chicago.</p>

<p>A clipping from the pages of one of Chicago's
great newspapers we leave to tell the last chapter
of the life of Ella Gingles.</p>

<p>In its few words it tells chapters of the faith
and confidence placed in the Irish lace-maker by
her friends in Chicago.</p>

<p>It was the last good-bye to the little foreigner
before she sailed back across the ocean to her
waiting parents and friends in the town of Larne,
Ireland.</p>

<p>The clipping, published under the date of
August 3, 1909, is as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
FRIENDS BID FAREWELL
TO MISS ELLA GINGLES<br />
<br />
<i>Impressive Reception for Acquitted Lace-maker<br />
Is Given by Illinois Orangemen, Who<br />
Present Bible and Purse.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"We believe in God, the Father Almighty,
Creator of heaven and earth; in Jesus Christ, His
Son, our only Mediator; in the Holy Spirit, the
Comforter, and in the Bible, His revealed will."</p>

<p>Quoting these words from the declaration in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the constitution of the Orangemen, adopted more
than two hundred years ago, Robert F. Brown,
Illinois state grand treasurer of the order, presented
a leather-bound copy of the Bible to Ella
Gingles. The Bible was the gift of the Ladies'
Loyal Orange Order of Chicago, and the presentation
was the climax of an impressive farewell
reception given by the Illinois organization of the
Orangemen order at Hopkins' Hall, Sixty-third
street and Stewart avenue, to the young Irish
lace-maker, who is to leave Chicago next Sunday
evening to return to the home of her parents in
Ireland.</p>

<p>On the fly-leaf of the book presented to the
young girl, who had passed through one of the
most grilling experiences ever witnessed in this
country, was inscribed the following:</p>

<p>"Presented to Miss Ella Gingles by the 'Chosen
Few,' Ladies' Loyal Orange Order, Chicago,
August 2,1909. May the Lord watch between
me and thee, while we are absent one from the
other.&mdash;Mrs. Jane M. Herbison, Mrs. Rebecca
McKeag, Mrs. Sarah Doonan."</p>

<p>More than five hundred persons, friends of
Miss Gingles, had crowded into the hall, filling
every available space. She sat throughout the
ceremonies, during which there were a number of
addresses, with Mrs. Mary Brem of the Catholic
Woman's League, and at whose home at 5488<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Ellis avenue she has been living since her acquittal.</p>

<p>William Russell, state grand master of the
order, presided. Addresses were made by Samuel
J. McCarroll, past grand master; H. H. Van
Meter of the Chicago Law and Order League,
and Rev. E. Keene Ryan of the Garfield Boulevard
Presbyterian Church.</p>

<p>Mr. McCarroll declared it was a blot upon the
citizenship of Chicago that conditions were such
that a young girl found it necessary to return to
her home in Europe in order to be entirely safe.</p>

<p>Miss Gingles also was presented with $100,
which was a part of a fund raised by clubwomen
in Chicago and by Rev. Mr. Ryan at a service at
his church on July 11. Out of the remainder of
the fund the expenses of the trip of Miss Gingles
and Miss Grace Van Duzen Cooke, who is to
accompany her, are to be paid.</p>

<p>Miss Gingles will leave Sunday evening for
New York, where she will be entertained by a
committee of Orangemen Tuesday and another
committee of the order will receive the girl and
her escort upon their arrival in Liverpool. Her
home is in Larne, Antrim County, Ireland.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
